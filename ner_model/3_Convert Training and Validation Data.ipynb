Of more than 700 chromosome counts RJS has compiled from the literature for this taxon the vast majority are between 2n = 80 and 147. Cultivated forms selected for lawns with soft flat leaves and loose tufts have generally been referred to P. pratensis subsp. irrigata, which is considered Eurasian in origin. Some authors suggest P. pratensis subsp. latifolia (Weihe ex Mert. & W.D.J.Koch) SchÃ¼bl. & G.Martens is the same taxon and is the correct name (Portal 2005) . At the species rank this subspecies has been called P. humilis Ehrh. ex Hoffm. and P. subcaerulea Sm. Poa pratensis is possibly the World s most complex species, fascinating in itself, but of which we know both much and too little. 16e. Poa pratensis subsp. pratensis http://species-id.net/wiki/Poa_pratensis_pratensis Fig. 18 C-J Description.

Further, members of several distinct genetic clusters share crown paÄ´ erns that correspond with formerly recognized genera.

In many diprotodontians, by contrast, damaged or sectioned skulls reveal the presence of a squamosal contribution to the floor of the hypotympanic sinus, in addition to an alisphenoid tympanic process (Aplin, 1990; Beck et al., 2008a: char. 244; SÃ¡nchez-Villagra and Forasiepi, 2017: 26, fig. 23 ).

MASTERS unpubl. data), but too few observations were made to be certain of this. Scrub Jays occasionally manipulated and once cached a tan colored, apparently inedible, seed. This suggests a seed discrimination ability less well developed than that of Clarks Nutcrackers and Piiion Jays. (Fig. 1 ). This feature, rare among corvids, increases the effective length of the Pifion Jays bill, resulting in a featherless bill equal in length to that of Clarks Nutcracker; it presumably minimizes contact between feathers and pine pitch. The types of seed transporting structures employed by the four corvids differed markedly. Clarks Nutcracker transports seeds in a sublingual pouch, a diverticulum of the mouth floor, opening anteriorly and laterally to the corneous tongue (BOCK et al. 1973) . The sublingual pouch may appear greatly distended when full of seeds or collapse and disappear from view when empty. The mean quantity of pifion pine seeds carried in the sublingual pouch of nutcrackers believed to be carrying maximal loads was 19.8 g and 19.7ml (n=6). The maximum quantity carried was 30.6 g and 28.5 ml, an amount equivalent to 90 medium sized P. edulis seeds. TOMBACK (1978) indirectly estimated (based on observations of foraging birds) a maximum capacity of 39 ml, a value which, until verified, we consider to be an overestimate. A capacity of 28.5 nil is assumed to be the maximum quantity of seeds that nutcrackers transport. Pifion Jays carry seeds in an esophagus distensible for approximately 2/:% its length. Histological preparations indicate that the Piiion Jays esophagus lacks elastic tissue. The mechanism allowing distension is apparently the simple relaxation of the esophageal muscles. Thus, as with the sublingual pouch of Clarks Nutcracker (BOCK et al. 1973) , the distensible esophagus of the Pifion Jay is a case of a structure performing a new function with only a minor change in form. The maximum capacity of the Pifion Jay esophagus is slightly more than half that of Clarks Nutcracker. 8 individuals with what appeared to be capacity loads carried between 34 and 41 (X=38.8) seeds and a 9th individual carried 56 P. edulis seeds. Weights and volumes of these samples were not determined but based on a mean seed weight of 0.3 g and a mean seed volume of 0.32ml (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977); a maximum capacity of approximately 16.8 and 17.9 ml is suggested. Males tend to carry more seeds than females but the differences are not significant (p > .05). The Stellers Jay, like the Piiion Jay, transports seeds in its esophagus (distensible for approximately /a its length). Histological preparations showed no elastic tissue and comparisons of gross morphology of the Stellers and Piiion Jay esophagi indicate no apparent differences. The mechanism of distensibility of the Stellers Jay esophagus is probably similar to that of the Pihon Jay, a simple relaxation of the esophageal muscles. This capability is less well developed however, as the Stellers Jay is capable of carrying fewer seeds. Observations at a feeding station of individuals that appeared to be carrying maximal loads indicate that the distensible esophagus can hold from 9 to 18 P. edulis seeds (X = 12.5, S.D. = 3.3, 11 = 22). A maximum capacity of 18 medium size P. edulis seeds is equivalent to 5.4 g and 5.8 ml. The Scrub Jay does not appear to have any specialized structures for carrying seeds. We have observed one to three P. edulis seeds being carried in the mouth and bill. MASTERS (unpubl. data) observed one to four ( j i = 1.4, Clarks Nutcracker carries seeds greater distances than any of the jays. The caching area of a population of nutcrackers on the San Francisco Mountains was 7.5 km from the nearest stand of pifion pine (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977) . This represents the minimum distance that pifion pine seeds must be carried for this population. The bulk of the pifion pine stand lies between 10 and 15 km from the seed-caching area and we often saw nutcrackers collecting seeds in this area. Nutcrackers have been observed collecting piiion pine seeds as far as 22 km from the nearest cache area (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977) . TOMBACK (1978) observed nutcrackers transporting whitebark pine seeds as far as 12.5 km. Nutcrackers appear to prefer harvesting seeds in areas nearest the caching area and travel greater distances as the seed crop nearest the cache area becomes depleted (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977) . Pifion Jays have been observed transporting seeds from the pifion-juniper woodland to their traditional breeding grounds in the ponderosa pine forest about 1 km away (BALDA and BATEMAN 1971) . Other populations of Pifion Jays in the San Francisco Mountains area have been observed carrying seeds at least 8 km and possibly further. In the Raft River Mountain, one of us (S.V.W.) has observed Piiion Jays transporting seeds from an isolated stand of P. monophylla to a cache area approximately 10 km away. Ten km appears to be the maximum distance that Piiion Jays transport seeds on these study areas, though typical distances range from 1 to 5 km. Few observations have been made of Stellers Jays transporting seeds. All observations of Stellers Jays foraging on pifion pines were made within 3 km of ponderosa pine forests, where individuals store seeds on their territories. Stellers Jays from the lower edge of the ponderosa pine forest are the only individuals that were observed participating in the pifion pine seed Frequencies a t which Scrub Jays were observed transporting piiion pine seeds The relationship between maximum quantity of seeds transported and the over given distances (n = 38) maximum distance seeds are transported for the four corvids. Line drawn by eye harvest. Three km appears to be the maximum distance Stellers Jays transport seeds. Scrub Jays collect seeds on or near their territories in the pifion-juniper woodland. Most Scrub Jays observed transporting seeds traveled less than 50 m, but a few individuals were observed flying as much as 500 m (Fig. 2) . In years of patchily distributed seed production, some individuals may leave their territories to collect seeds in neighboring areas and then transport them back to their territories up to 1 km away (F. F~T E L K A pers. comm.; pers. obs.). The maximum distance a species will travel to harvest seeds is correlated (r = 0.98) with the capacity of the seed-transporting structure (Fig. 3 ) . As will be demonstrated below, this relationship exists because the capacity of the food-transporting structure, along with specializations influencing flight speed, is an important determinant of the distance to which an individual can profitably travel to harvest seeds. The flight behavior of these corvids when transporting seeds varies markedly. Clarks Nutcrackers are bold, strong, direct fliers which frequently fly well above the forest canopy (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977) . In mountainous areas, nutcrackers seem to make use of winds and updrafts to gain lift (VANDER WALL et al. in press), a behavior which presumably reduces energy expended over long flights with heavy loads. Pifion Jays are also strong, direct fliers but usually fly through or just above the forest canopy (BALDA and BATEMAN 1971) . Both nutcrackers and Pifion Jays seldom stop to rest when transporting seeds. In contrast, Stellers and Scrub Jays are weak, slow fliers that frequently glide and move through the canopy secretively, stopping frequently. These differences in behavior are most easily quantified in terms of mean flight speed of seed-transporting individuals (Table 1) . Mean flight speed increases in the order: Scrub Jay, Stellers Jay, Picon Jay, Clarks Nutcracker, with all species significantly different except Picon Jays and Clarks Nutcrackers (F:i,6,, = 15.07, p < .05; Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test, p < .05). Flight speed is significantly correlated with mean bill length (r = 0.92, p < .05) and maximum quantity of seeds transported (r = 0.96, p < .05), relative measures of foraging and seed-transporting specialization, respectively. Nutcrackers and jays almost invariably cache seeds in the soil (GRINNELL 1936; BROWN 1963 b; TURCEK and KELSO 1968; BALDA and BATEMAN 1971; VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977; TOMBACK 1978 TOMBACK , 1980 but occasionally seeds are placed in cracks in rock outcroppings, crevices in tree trunks or clumps of dense foliage. Caches are made similarly by all four corvids. After an appropriate site is selected the bill is jabbed into the soil once or twice. This apparently serves to loosen the soil and may provide additional information on the nature of the substrate. One or more seeds are then cached by holding them, usually one at a time, in the tip of the bill and inserting them into the loosened soil. Seeds are usually cached at a depth of 1 to 3 cm. Three important differences in the caching behavior of these corvids are apparent: cache size, habitat in which seeds are cached and caching system (i.e. territorial or communal). The jays usually make one-seed caches but Clarks Nutcracker and, to a lesser extent, Piiion Jays make many caches containing more than one seed ( Table 2) . Size of caches made by nutcrackers reported here is very similar to those found by TOMBACK (1978: X = 4.2 * 2.9, n = 214 caches). Caches of small conifer seeds (e.g. ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir seeds) prepared by nutcrackers and Piiion Jays may be considerably larger than those of large conifer seeds shown in Seeds are cached in every major habitat occurring in the study areas. In the San Francisco Mountains, Clarks Nutcrackers transport piiion pine seeds to cache areas in the mixed coniferous forest (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977). S T E P H E N B. V A N D E R W Seeds are cached at elevations from 2525 to 2750 m, approximately 600 m higher than where the seeds were collected. The cache areas, steep southfacing slopes, lose their snow cover 1 to 2 months earlier than the adjacent north-facing slopes and during years of light snowfall may be free from snow intermittently during the winter. In the Raft River Mountains, piiion pine seeds are occasionally cached in the piiion-juniper woodland but more frequently they are transported to mixed coniferous forests, sagebrush slopes and mountain mahogany forests. Cache sites used most frequently are wind-swept ridges, south-facing slopes and cliff faces from 1825 to 2950 m elevation. Piiion Jays cache seeds in ponderosa pine forests and pifion-juniper woodlands, usually on the south side of trees, south-facing slopes and open windy areas, the first areas to lose their snow cover after a storm (BALDA and BATE-MAN 1971; LIGON 1978). Stellers Jays cache seeds in the ponderosa pine forest and Scrub Jays cache seeds in the pifion-juniper woodland. Both Scrub and Pifion Jays may carry seeds downslope into clearings (LIGON 1978 ; R.P.B. pers. obs.). Thus, each species caches seeds in different habitats, and at both study sites pifion pine seeds are cached in all major vegetation types. Clarks Nutcrackers and Pifion Jays cache seeds in communal cache areas (BALDA and BATEMAN 1971; VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977; LIGON 1978) . While Pifion Jay cache areas are on or near their traditional breeding grounds (BALDA and BATEMAN 1971) , nutcracker cache areas may be unassociated with breeding areas (MEWALDT 1956; VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977; TOMBACK 1978 ). On these areas many individuals intermix their caches with few aggressive interactions. However, the seed stores are not communal and usually, each individual recovers only the seeds it stores (but see VANDER WALL in prep.). Stellers and Scrub Jays cache seeds on their territories (BROWN 1963 a; MASTERS unpubl. data) and food stores are apparently shared only with the mate and young. The relative degree to which nutcrackers and jays are dependent on stored pine seeds can be determined by comparing four aspects of their behavior during the winter and breeding season: I. proportion of the diet composed of storcd pine seeds during the winter and early spring; 2. frequency and extent of eruptive movements during the fall and winter; 3. timing of the breeding season; and 4. proportion of the nestling diet composed of stored pine seeds. A. Winter Diet. Clarks Nutcrackers feed predominantly on conifer seeds with between SO and 100 % of their diet composed of seeds during November through February (GIUNTOLI and MEWALDT 1978) . The majority of the seeds eaten probably came from caches, as seeds in cones are usually depleted by October or November. Pifion Jays also rely heavily on cached pine seeds for winter food, taking between 70 and 9 0 % in their diet during the months of November through February (LIGON 1978) . N o data are available on the winter use of stored pine seeds by Stellers Jays and Scrub Jays but the extensive use of acorn mast during the winter in California (BEAL 1910) suggests that stored food is an important source of energy in the winter. The stomach contents of Stellers Jays during the months of November, December and January contained 76, 90 and 99 % acorn mast, respectively. For Scrub Jays the quantity of acorn mast consumed was: November, 66 %; December, 73 9%; January, 75 %; and February, 69 %. A high proportion of these acorns may have come from caches made the previous fall, since these birds store acorns industriously (GRINNELL 1936; BENT 1946; BROWN 1963 BROWN b, 1964 . Although generalizations concerning diets in different habitats should be treated with caution, these data suggest that stored pine seeds on our study areas may be used similarly. B. Eruptive Movements. The response of nutcrackers and jays to local or regional cone crop failure further indicates the importance 01 stored seed in the winter diet. At frequent intervals nutcrackers participate in large scale eruptions WILLIAMS 1957, 1964; BOCK and LEPTHIEN 1976; VANDER WALL et al. in press) where individuals or flocks invade prairies, deserts and Pacific coastal areas (American Ornithologists Union 1957). These eruption movements are thought to be caused by one crop failure WILLIAMS 1957, 1964) . Pifion Jays also participate in these eruptions (HENDERSON 1920; American Ornithologists Union 1957; WESTCOTT 1964). Stellers and Scrub Jays rarely erupt and the rarity of extralimital sightings suggest that movements are of a local nature (AIKEN and WARREN 1914; MAILLIARD 1927; WESTCOTT 1969) . WESTCOTT (1969) suggested that some Stellers and Scrub Jay movements are in response to factors other than cone crop failure. Differences in the degree to which these species participate in eruptive movements are reflected in their population structure. The agility of Clarks Nutcrackers and Piiion Jays has apparently resulted in frequent mixing of local populations. Consequently these species are monotypic and show little detectable geographic variation (MAYR and SHORT 1970) . Conversely, the more sedentary Stellers and Scrub Jays experience less mixing of local populations allowing greater adaptation to local environments. This has resulted in much geographic variation, with Stellers and Scrub jays having 6 and 12 recognized subspecies, respectively, in western North America (American Ornithologists Union 1957). Thus, differences in population structure of Clarks Nutcracker and Pifion Jays on one hand and Stellers and Scrub Jays on the other may, in part, reflect differences in their dependence on conifer seeds. C. Timing of the Breeding Season. Nutcrackers and Piiion Jays are two of the earliest nesting passerines in North America, initiating breeding activities in February with egg laying beginning as early as late February and extending to early or mid April (SKINNER 1916; BRADBURY 1917; MEWALDT 1956; BALDA and BATEMAN 1973) . If the first nesting attempt fails, second or third attempts may extend into May and June (BALDA and BATEMAN 1971; BENT 1946). The early occurrence of nutcracker and Pifion Jay breeding is related to their food-storage habits (cf. VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977; LIGON 1978) . LIGON (1978) demonstrated that an ad libitum diet of piiion pine seeds accelerated gonadal development in captive Pifion Jays. BALDA and BATEMAN (1973) demonstrated that the time of breeding of Piiion Jays was not dependent on weather conditions just prior to nesting but on the size of the cone crop the previous fall. Large cone crops allow the Piiion Jay to store large amounts of pine seeds which presumably provides the energy for gonadal development and courtship, both of which occur under winter conditions, as well as a portion of the energy for nest building, egg laying and incubation (BALDA and BATEMAN 1973) . The relationship between breeding date and conifer seed availability has not been investigated for the nutcracker. However, conifer seeds comprise between 70 and 9 8 % of the nutcrackers diet with a frequency of 100% (n = 117 stomachs) during the months of March and April following years of seed production (GIUNTOLI and MEWALDT 1978) . The importance of conifer seeds in the nutcrackers diet at this time suggests that early breeding in Clarks Nutcracker is probably controlled by mechanisms similar to those found in Piiion Jays. The advantages of early breeding for both nutcrackers and Pifioii Jays appear to be increased time for young to gain weight and foraging experience before the onset of winter, resulting in increased survivorship of young (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977; LIGON 1978 ). Stellers and Scrub Jays differ from the above species in that they breed much later with egg-laying occurring in April and May (JENSEN 1923; GRIN-NELL et al. 1930; BENT 1946; HARDY 1961) . Again, the spring diet of these two jays on the study area is unknown, but a parallel may be drawn from jays in other areas. I n California, Stellers Jay stomachs did not contain acorns during the month of May and acorn mast composed only 10% of the diet in June (no data for April, BEAL 1910). Scrub Jay stomachs contained 2 5 % acorn mast in April, less than 1 % in May and 2 % in June. The balance of the diets was composed primarily of insects. Again, caution is required when generalizing about coniferous forest jays but these data suggest that winter food stores are either depleted or not used in the spring when animal food becomes available. (LACK 1968; MORTON 1973) . Nestling Pifion Jays, by contrast, were fed less than 10 % conifer seeds following a bumper pifion pine cone crop (BATEMAN and BALDA 1973) . LIGON (1978) found that pifion pine seeds formed an important part of the nestling diet on an irregular basis, seeds being used most extensively when unfavorable environmental conditions precluded capture of insects. The diet of nestling Pifion Jays consists primarily of arthropods. Data are not available on the types of food fed to the young of Stellers and Scrub Jays on our study area but VERBEEK (1970) states that the food brought to young Scrub Jays is diverse and WHEELOCK (1904) states that young Stellers Jays are fed insects and berries.', {'entities': [(0, 0, 'SPECIMEN')]}], ['Oocytes were mounted in glycerol/1,4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO at 100 mg/ml; Aldrich) to retard photobleaching.', {'entities': [(0, 0, 'SPECIMEN')]}], ['Benthic Î´ 13 C dataset (f, black line) is also from ODP Site 999a (data from Haug and Tiedemann, 1998; Bickert et al., 2004) and the dotted line is from a composite Pacific benthic Î´ 13 C dataset of Billups (2002) .', {'entities': [(0, 0, 'SPECIMEN')]}], ['The two extant known syntypes of Sternarchus mormyrus (NMW 65336, 65345; Eschmeyer, 1998 Eschmeyer, : 1122 , both have regenerated tails makes it impossible to determine the total length and other distances and proportions that are a function of that measurement.', {'entities': [(0, 0, 'SPECIMEN')]}], ['Holotype, female: EQUATORIAL GUINEA: Uelleburg, VI-1908 -VIII-1908 Tessman, USNM ENT 00764790 (deposited in ZMHU).', {'entities': [(0, 0, 'SPECIMEN')]}], ['New English name: Wavy Jaw Slopefish ( Figure 1A ; Table 1) Holotype: MZB 19251 (formerly LBRC-F 2837), male, 181 mm SL, fish market at Tanjung Kodok, Bitung, North Sulawesi, Indonesia, hook and line, no depth data, 2 May 2012, collected by T.

Although C. appendiculatus was originally distinguished from C. undecimalis mainly by the presence of gas-bladder appendages, this character is now known to be variable (Meek and Hildebrand, 1925) . These appendages are present in some specimens and reduced or obsolete in others. The other differences given are clearly ontogenetic. Contrary to Poeys usual procedure, the original description of C. appendiculatus is not based on a designated single specimen. Three individuals, 400, 600 and 900 mm TL, are mentioned, but only in relation to body depth and eye diameter. Howell-Rivero (1938) stated that a specimen 230 mm TL (MCZ 10274), another 330 mm TL (MCZ 10306) and a disarticulated skeleton of a specimen about 540 mm TL (MCZ 34156) are cotypes of C. The holotype of C. argenteus, 93 mm SL (BMNH 1862.12.15.80) , is a juvenile C. undecimalis. This nominal species had been previously synonymized with C. undecimalis by Regan (1907) himself. Type.-The holotype is a specimen 160 mm SL (ZMB 38). Presumbly, this is the specimen used by Bloch for the original description and figure (H.-J. Paepke, pers. cor.). Remarks.-There are no diagnostic characters in the original description whereby the species can be recognized. The figure, however, shows the second and third anal spines with the correct relative length for the species usually recognized as C. undecimalis. The nomenclatorial status of this species was definitely established by Chavez (1961) Distribution (Fig. 6 ). are modally nine dorsal-fin rays in those referable to C. viridis and modally 10 in those referable to C. nigrescens. Also, the specimens of C. viridis have usually 10 or 11 nonrudimentary lower limb gill rakers but those of C. nigrescens usually have only eight or nine, a much wider interorbital and a shorter second anal spine. The holotype confirms the character states just given for C. nigrescens and the narrower interorbital and longer anal spine in C. viridis agrees with its original description. Apparently for the reasons given above, Boulenger (1895), Gilbert and Starks (1904) and Distribution (Fig. 9) O 100 .90 I80 7 --0 40 Types. Remarks. -Greenfield (1975) in reporting three specimens from Belize as C. poeyi gave counts that apply to C. undecimalis rather than to C. poeyi. I refer in particular to the eight or nine lower limb nonrudimentary gill rakers (11 or 12 in C. poeyi), the 69-71 lateral scales (73-80 This content downloaded from 35.7.8.208 on Mon, 24 Oct 2022 22:30:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms in C. poeyi) and the 15 or 16 pectoral-fin rays (modally 16 in C. poeyi). As to the six anal rays, third spine longer than second and pelvic fin not reaching to anus, these character states are common to both C. undecimalis and C. poeyi. Greenfield did not mention the number of dorsal-fin rays which is modally 10 in C. undecimalis and nine in C. poeyi. This character state alone distinguishes these two species.

The standard deviation of the distances is cr = -Pk)-Therefore, the number of standard deviations d is from expectation is s = (fi -d)/cr. The probability of a value as large as s can be found in any table of normal probability. The expected composition of nucleotide sets in the reconstructed ancestor comes from the same calculation, since i and j will lead, either by intersection or union, to a defined nucleotide set with a frequency fif/. If all the fif/ are summed according to the nucleotide set formed from i and j , one gets the expected distribution of nucleotide sets in the ancestor. It is important to determine this expected distribution since it, rather than the exact reconstructed composition, must be used to calculate further mutation probabilities when these reconstructed ancestors are considered as descendants from which still more remote ancestors are reconstructed. Because the sequences of the more remote ancestors are dependent upon the reconstruction of the sequences of less remote ancestors, expectations regarding the mutational differences of two remote ancestors must be similarly dependent. It should be noted that a change in the third coding position can never lead to more than one other amino acid being encoded. As might be suspected from Figure 1 , this procedure appears to be less sensitive in distinguishing convergence from divergence where there are only two (and sometimes but one) character states. Therefore, the following analyses were performed using only the first two of the three nucleotide positions in each codon. Also, the computer program at its present stage of development has serine represented as A or U in the first coding position and G or C in the second, with the consequence that cysteine, which is represented as U in the first and G in the second position, is not recognized as being one nucleotide replacement away. The statistical computations make proper allowance for this fact. To demonstrate that the statistical methods correctly predict the expected result when the sequences are truly unrelated, 16 independent sequences of 100 amino acids were assigned randomly to the tips of a tree whose structure (topology) was as if each line of descent from the ultimate ancestor successively divided exactly and symmetrically three more times. The statistical computation indicated that the two reconstructed penultimate ancestors would be expected to average 70.2 Â± 6.8 mutations distant in the first and second coding nucleotides. Upon their reconstruction, they were found to be 77 mutations distant or (70.2 -77)/6.8 = -1.0 standard deviation from the mean expectation. Since approximately % of all random events fall within 1 cr of the mean expectation, the difference is not statistically significant and there is thus no evidence that the two groups of eight have any relationship-as indeed should be the case. Varying the number of the random sequences analyzed did not significantly affect the variation of the found distance about the mean expectation as shown by the circles in Figure 3 . Since it could be argued that the random assignment of these sequences to an a priori topology is unfair because in the normal case one first seeks out the best fitting tree for the sequence data, the 16 random sequences were also tested this way. The best tree is shown in Figure 4 . The number of species in the two groups being compared is shown on the x-axis. The y-axis shows the number of standard deviations, s, that a given result is from expectation. Wherever open symbols are used the species are divided equally between the two groups. The circles represent random sequences of amino acids (two unrelated groups of unrelated sequences), the triangles represent sequences from the convergent model (two unrelated groups of related sequences), and the squares represent known cytochromes c (two related groups of related sequences). The closed circle represents the random sequences calculated accordnig to the tree in Figure 4 . For the cytochromes, the set of two species is composed of man and saccharomyces iso-1. The set of four adds duck and saccharomyces iso-2 to the preceding group. The set of six adds tuna and Candida to the preceding group. The set of eight adds drosophila and debaromyces to the preceding group. The set of ten adds wheat and Neurospora to the preceding group. The set of 24 cytochromes c (closed square, species divided unequally) is composed of two groups of 5 fungal and 19 metazoan species as shown in Figure 5 . The closed triangle at 24 is for the set of similarly divided, convergent proteins as shown in Figure 6 . The closed triangle at 17 is a set of convergent proteins containing only FUB from the FUN group and 16 randomly selected sequences from the MET group. The axis on the right side of the figure gives the negative exponent of 10 (k) for the probability that by chance a result may be as It is clearly unlike the trees one usually obtains using real homologous sequences or even the artificial sequences that resulted from the model convergent process. What this tree essentially depicts is that every sequence is approximately equidistant from every other sequence. For this random model, it would be expected that the penultimate ancestors would average 71.0 Â± 6.8 mutations distant in the first and second coding nucleotides. Upon their reconstruction by the above procedure, they were found to be 77 mutations distant or (71-77)/6.8 = 0.88 a. Since the initial random sequences are ~150 mutations distant while the reconstructed ancestors are only 77 mutations apart, there is the surface appearance of a divergent process. But since the calculation tells us that the reconstruction procedure would create this much apparent divergence (indeed a little more) we are in no danger of concluding that these random sequences are the result of a divergent evolution. This verifies once again that unrelated sequences lead to ancestral sequences whose mutation distance upon reconstruction by a carefully prescribed process can be reasonably estimated. Finally, to be certain that this result is due to the unrelatedness of the sequences rather than a randomness of the amino acids which might not be present in real protein sequences, the entire procedure many standard deviation units away from the mean as the corresponding values of s shown on the left side. The k are very nearly equidistant and are all the sums of consecutive numbers starting at 1 with the result that the n th number up is k = n(n + l ) / 2 . If n is set equal to 0.609 s and k calculated, then the probability of a value s & from the mean is 10~k. The probability value is precise for s = 1.644 (p = 10 1 ). At s = 7, p is calculated to be 6.62 X 10 12 when it is really 2.55 X 10~1 2 so the result is conservative. The relative error continues to increase as the probability decreases but the result is always conservative. Thus, we have a simple way of estimating p for large values of s in the absence of extensive tables for the normal distribution. Tree for Random Sequences of Amino Acids. Tree depicts the result when the computer was forced to discover the evolutionary relationships among 16 random sequences of 100 amino acids each. The % SD is only 3.4. All three codon nucleotide positions were used in formulating this tree. was repeated using the first 100 amino acids of 16 presumably unrelated proteins whose sequences have been determined. 2 The sequences were randomly assigned to the branch tips of a tree with the same topology as the first random case above. Calculation showed that the ancestors of the two groups of eight would be expected to be 71 mutations apart and were in fact 64 mutations distant or 1.07 standard deviation units from the mean, i.e., not significantly different from expectation. The statistical procedure is such that the nucleotide most frequent in two descendants is expected to be even more frequent in their immediate ancestor. This process, if continued through a sufficient number of ancestors, could conceivably cause some difficulty in estimating the mutation distance expected between the reconstructed ancestors of two very large unrelated groups of unrelated nucleotide sequences. The results with the random sequences, as shown in Figure 3 , fail to give any evidence that the present numbers of sequences cause any real difficulty. To demonstrate that proteins which evolved convergently are not given the appearance of having evolved divergently when the previously described method of ancestral sequence reconstruction is used, one could test the method on convergently evolved proteins. Since none of these are available, a model set of proteins was created, and the method tested on these. For this purpose it was decided that the general structure of their evolution should be as much as possible like the evolution of cytochrome c shown in Figure 5 . To this end, the fungal and metazoan portions of this tree were exactly reproduced in the convergent model but only in so far as the topology and the number of mutations on each descending leg is concerned. First of all, two ancestral genes called FUN and MET, 104 codons long, were obtained by random selection where each codons probability of being selected was equal to its presumed frequency in the primordial cytochrome c gene. Using the sequence of human cytochrome c as the standard of fitness, potential mutations were randomly generated for various positions in the two sequences. Any mutation which would not increase the fitness of a sequence was not accepted. The general requirements of acceptability for a mutation were as follows. The new amino acid encoded as a result of a mutation and the previously encoded (old) amino acid were compared to the desired amino acid in that position of human cytochrome c. The following convergence rules for phenotypic convergence were used and the mutation, and therefore the new amino acid, was not accepted whenever: 1. the old amino acid was already identical to the desired amino acid; 2. the codon for the old amino acid was as few nucleotide replacements from the codon of the desired amino acid as was the new codon 3 ; 3 This rule number 2, unlike the others, selects at the level of the genotype rather than at the level of the phenotype. It was adopted solely to assure that the amount of convergence obtained per mutation accepted was maximized. When used, rules number 4 and 6 become redundant. The convergent model which produced the sequences compared in Figure 7 did not employ 3. the old amino acid was of the same polarity as the desired amino acid but the new amino acid was not (for this purpose, the non-polar amino acids were ala,cys,phe, ileu,leu,met,pro,trp,tyr, and val; the other ten were regarded as polar); 4. the old amino acid had the same charge as the desired amino acid but the new one did not 3 ; 5. the old amino acid was uncharged and polar, the desired amino acid was nonpolar but the new amino acid was charged; 6. the old amino acid was a member of the same subgroup as the desired amino acid but the new amino acid was not (the subgroups are A, tyr and phe; B, val, met, leu, and ileu; C, gly,ala and val; and D, ser and thr) 3 ; 7. the desired amino acid was polar, and the new amino acid was a larger non-polar amino acid than the old one (for this purpose, size was set as trp>tyr>phe>met> leu = ileu>val = pro>cys>ala); 8. the total charge on the molecule moved out of or away from the range of 10.5 Â± 1 excess of positive over negative charges (his was given half a charge). Finally, for simplicity, it was decided not to permit a given nucleotide position to mutate more than once in the descent from an ancestor to its next immediate descendant and that while silent mutations (which dont change the amino acids encoded) were allowed, they were not counted among those mutations necessary to reach a descendant. Table I presents a general summary of the minimum mutation distances between the various proteins being considered in the convergent model. The original FUN and MET ancestral sequences were 156.5 rule 2 and hence convergence was more gradual. It was necessary to omit rule 2 in this case because the intent was to show that selection at the level of the phenotype leads to convergence at the level of the genotype. The tree is the best-fitting one found for the sequences 4 employed. All three codon nueleotide positions were used in formulating this tree. The number on the various legs indicate the number of nueleotide replacements assigned to that particular descent upon reconstruction of the ancestral sequences according to previously described rules (Fitch and Margoliash, 1967) . 1 The minimal mutation distance between the genes encoding two amino acid sequences is the minimum number of nucleotide differences that must be postulated to account for the observed differences in their sequence. The implication is that, since their common ancestor if they had one, this number of mutations or nucleotide replacements would have to have been fixed to explain their divergence. FUA -> E and MEF -> Y are the two major groups formed by the descent from the FUN and MET ancestral genes respectively. FUN and MET are names derived from a stretched analogy to fungi and metazoan ancestral cytochromes c which led to this model case. The ancestors, FU and ME, were reconstructed from the descendant species using the found phylogeny in Figure 6 and the reconstruction rules given in the text. Human cytochrome c is the standard of fitness toward which the FUN and MET ancestral sequences were made to evolve. The numbers in columns A and B are the average of 5 and 19 values respectively. Distances were calculated on the basis of all three coding positions. Â± 4.5 nucleotide replacements distant from the human cytochrome c toward which they were to converge. This is almost exactly 1.5 mutations/coding position, which is about what one would expect from a pair of random proteins. The descendant sequences FUA through MEY average 121 mutations away from human cytochrome c. Thus, the true net convergence has amounted to about 35 nucleotide replacements, demonstrating that the model does produce convergence. However, the ancestral forms, FUN and MET, were initially only 149 mutations apart from each other (as opposed to their 156 replacements away from cytochrome c) and their descendants were still, on the average, 131.6 mutations apart from each other. This gives a relative convergence between the two groups of only 17 mutations. With real proteins it is unlikely that anything other than relative convergence would be observable. The convergent model proved interesting in part because the computer program, in attempting to reconstruct the phylogeny of the FUN and MET descendants, found a better tree than the actual tree. The % SD (standard deviation), which is an estimate of the error between the measured mutation distances between species and those distances computed for the tree under consideration, was 5.6% for the actual tree (see Fitch and Margoliash, 1967 for details). The error was reduced to 5.1% for the best fitting (or found) tree. Figure 6 shows a comparison between these two trees. The solid lines are identical for both trees. Where the trees differ, the structure of the actual tree is shown by dashed lines while the structure of the best-fitting found tree is shown by dotted lines. The found, rather than the actual, tree was used in reconstructing ancestral sequences because similar discrepancies must occur when using real protein sequences. The reconstructed ancestors of the convergent model prove to have only 117 mutations separating them in the first and second nucleotide positions, compared to 122 for the descendants, so that we have, seemingly, a small divergence where we know convergence has occurred. Thus, finding that the mutation distance between ancestral sequences reconstructed by the methods presented is less than the distance between the present day, descendant sequences is not sufficient to demonstrate the presence of an homologous relationship. The statistical calculation on the found tree of the convergent model indicates, assuming the sequences are all unrelated, The two random sequences, FUN and MET, were allowed to evolve according to the topology shown by the solid plus dashed lines (the actual tree) and under the rules given in the text for selection for convergence. Using all three coding nucleotides, the bestfitting tree was reconstructed according to previously described procedures (Fitch and Margoliash, 1967) . This found tree, where topologically identical to the actual tree, is shown by solid lines; where different, by dotted lines. The topology and the number of mutations accepted into each segment of the actual tree conforms to that for a set of 24 cytochromes c shown in Figure 5 . The mutation numbers at the nodal points are only those mutations in the first and second coding positions. The numbers represent those mutations occurring between the node at which the numbers appear and the two immediate descendants of that node. The number to the left of the slash is the number of mutations incorporated into the first two coding positions in the actual tree, the number to the right of the slash is the number of mutations discovered upon reconstruction by the present method. that the reconstructed FUN and MET ancestral sequences would be expected to average 54.1 Â± 6.3 mutations distant in the first and second nucleotides. Reconstruction according to the procedure discussed in connection with Figure 2 finds them 117 mutations distant. This is (54-117) /6.3 = -9.95 standard deviation units from the mean expection. The probability of this result occurring by chance alone is less than 10~2 1 . The result is almost identical if the actual rather than the found tree is used. The triangles in Figure 3 show how the number of convergent proteins involved in the computation affects the calculation. No significant result was obtained until 10 species were included. However, as shown by the closed triangle, even 17 species is insufficient if one of the two groups contains only one species. There must be multiple representation in both groups to detect a significant relationship. It might be objected that our ability to detect convergence was dependent upon testing against each other two reconstructed ancestral sequences which were originally as remote as two random sequences. Dr. 107. The value of X 2 Â»PP is 3.94 for which the probability that this result could be a chance event is 0.048. The method for determining X 2 Â»PP has been submitted for publication. The two sequences are from a model case not otherwise discussed but which started with the same ancestral pair of sequences. More mutations were accepted, but since rule 2 regarding acceptability of mutations was omitted, the total amount of convergence was less than that of the convergent model in Figure 6 . M. Susman pointed out that if much of the convergence had already occurred prior to the point in time represented by the two ancestral forms being compared, the task would not be so easy. This is true, but the power of the method is indicated by eliminating species FUD through MEL from the data so that one is now reconstructing the ancestral forms only as far back as shown by the stars in Figure 6 . Thus over 50% of the net convergence in the two groups had occurred prior to the appearance of the two ancestral forms to be compared. Nevertheless, the convergence was detected with a probability that the result could de due to chance equal to 2 X 10~6 as shown by the star on Figure 3 . Such convergent sequences also provide an answer to the question asked earlier, i.e., might not the constraints on an optimal functional fitness be sufficiently severe that a convergent evolution will produce two analogous proteins which will appear related, not only chemically but by the criterion of genetic relatedness previously set forth. The answer is yes. Figure 7 shows a comparison between two sequences obtained in a convergent model which give the appearance of being homologous. The probability that this much similarity would occur by chance is less than .05 (Fitch, 1970b) . It required examination of an extraordinarily large length of sequence (60 amino acids) to detect this, but then greater convergence would have reduced the length required. The preceding computations show that when two sets of proteins have been caused to converge to somewhat similar chemical structures, the reconstructed ancestral sequences are less alike than would have been the case had all the presumed descendant sequences been in fact totally unrelated. What is the result when the same computations are performed for cytochrome c which has, presumably, the same number of mutations placed on the corresponding segments of a topology identical to the one used in the convergent model? The calculations were performed using 24 species and the tree shown in Figure 5 . The statistical calculation indicates, assuming the present day fungal and metazoan cytochromes are all unrelated, that the reconstructed ancestral sequences for the fungal and metazoan groups would be expected to average 63.4 Â± 6.8 mutations distant in the first and second coding nucleotides. Reconstruction finds them only 21 mutations distant. This is (63.4-21)/6.8 = 6.3 standard deviations from the mean expectation. The probability of this result occurring by chance alone is less than 6 X 10~1 0 . Thus both convergent and divergent processes are shown to give statistically significant departures from the expectation and furthermore these departures are at opposite extremes of the distribution. It may appear to some that this procedure contradicts a basic philosophical principle that, given information on a system at only one point in time, one can not tell in which direction the system is moving in the time coordinate. The principle is sound, and it should be clearly recognized that my procedure can not distinguished between 24 cytochromes c which have diverged from a single ancestral gene and 24 independently arising cytochromes c which are converging on a single future descendant form. These are the pure forms of convergence and divergence and are identical except for a reversal of the time axis. As Dr. R. L. Metzenberg pointed out to me, what we have ruled out in the case of cytochrome c is a specific mixture of the two. And this can be done because the assumption of divergence permits (within limits) one to describe past states of the system knowing the present state (i.e., nucleotide sequences). Thus, if one accepts divergence for the genes within two select groups, say within the artiodactyl and carnivore hemoglobins, one can ask if their past states, which are describable under the a priori assumption of divergence, plus their present states are together consistent with the groups being convergent or divergent. This we can do because we now have character states at two points in time. The result is that we may show that the present-day sequences are consistent with pure divergence but not with mixtures of convergence and divergence, with a monophyletic origin but not with a biphyletic origin. One can maintain con-vergence in the cytochrome c gene as a logical possibility only by going all the way and assuming that there must have been a very large number of origins (perhaps as many as 24) to the 24 cytochromes c that were analyzed in this study. But if such a position is to be advocated, one must also explain how so many independently arising genes should have, by themselves, led to a phylogeny of these species ( Figure 5 ) which is so similar to the phylogeny biologists have produced using other characters. The explanation will become more tedious as other genes produce similar results until, like the geocentric view of the solar system, it collapses under the burden of epicycles of epicycles.
