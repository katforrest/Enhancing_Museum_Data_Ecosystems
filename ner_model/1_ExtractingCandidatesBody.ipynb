      "The multiple copy nature and unique size of these male-specific fragments provided us with the opportunity to efficiently isolate Y chromosome-derived \"720-related clones from a C57BL/10 male library. Here we report the isolation and characterization of two mouse Y chromosome-derived clones containing M72O-related sequences. We present evidence that these clones are derived from a repeated segment that contains a sequence specific to the Y chromosome, designated YBlO, several sequences enriched on the Y chromosome, a previously undescribed Y-linked retrovirus, designated MuRVY (K. W. HUTCHISON and E. M . EICHER unpublished data), and at least two ubiquitous repeats. We also present evidence that approximately 5% of the C57BL/10J Y chromosome is composed of a 7.4-kb EcoRI fragment containing both YB 10 and MuRVY-related sequences. We speculate on the evolution of YBlO and MuRVY in the Y chromosome of the genus Mus. We suggest that both sequences became associated with the Y chromosome of species in the subgenus Mus following divergence of this subgenus from other Mus subgenera. Divergence and subsequent amplification of the region of the Y chromosome containing these sequences occurred in the species M . spretus, M. hortulanus, M. musculus, M. domesticus and M . abbotti.

Isolation of M720-related clones: The EcoRI partialdigest library of C57BL/10 male DNA cloned into Charon 4A (WEAVER et al. 1981) was screened by the procedure of BENTON and DAVIS (1977) using a pBR322 clone of M720 viral DNA (PHILLIPS et al. 1982) .

A total of 2.2 X lo5 phage were screened under the DNA hybridization conditions given in PHILLIPS et al. (1982) . Preparation of DNA and radiolabeling of probes: Recombinant phage DNAs were prepared using the small lysate method of LEDER, TIEMEIER and ENQUIST (1977) or the glycerol gradient preparative method of MANIATIS, FRITSCH and SAMBROOK (1982) . T h e DNA was digested with restriction enzymes and appropriate fragments were isolated from low melting temperature agarose gels (WEIS-LANDER 1979) and used as probes or subcloned into plasmid pBR325 by standard procedures (MANIATIS, FRITSCH and SAMBROOK 1982) .

      "Scrub Jays appear not to use \"bill-clicking'' when testing seed quality (N. MASTERS unpubl. data), but too few observations were made to be certain of this. Scrub Jays occasionally manipulated and once cached a tan colored, apparently inedible, seed. This suggests a seed discrimination ability less well developed than that of Clark's Nutcrackers and Piiion Jays. (Fig. 1 ). This feature, rare among corvids, increases the effective length of the Pifion Jay's bill, resulting in a featherless bill equal in length to that of Clark's Nutcracker; it presumably minimizes contact between feathers and pine pitch. The types of seed transporting structures employed by the four corvids differed markedly. Clark's Nutcracker transports seeds in a sublingual pouch, a diverticulum of the mouth floor, opening anteriorly and laterally to the corneous tongue (BOCK et al. 1973) . The sublingual pouch may appear greatly distended when full of seeds or collapse and disappear from view when empty. The mean quantity of pifion pine seeds carried in the sublingual pouch of nutcrackers believed to be carrying maximal loads was 19.8 g and 19.7ml (n=6). The maximum quantity carried was 30.6 g and 28.5 ml, an amount equivalent to 90 medium sized P. edulis seeds. TOMBACK (1978) indirectly estimated (based on observations of foraging birds) a maximum capacity of 39 ml, a value which, until verified, we consider to be an overestimate. A capacity of 28.5 nil is assumed to be the maximum quantity of seeds that nutcrackers transport. Pifion Jays carry seeds in an esophagus distensible for approximately 2/:% its length. Histological preparations indicate that the Piiion Jay's esophagus lacks elastic tissue. The mechanism allowing distension is apparently the simple relaxation of the esophageal muscles. Thus, as with the sublingual pouch of Clark's Nutcracker (BOCK et al. 1973) , the distensible esophagus of the Pifion Jay is a case of a structure performing a new function with only a minor change in form. The maximum capacity of the Pifion Jay esophagus is slightly more than half that of Clark's Nutcracker. 8 individuals with what appeared to be capacity loads carried between 34 and 41 (X=38.8) seeds and a 9th individual carried 56 P. edulis seeds. Weights and volumes of these samples were not determined but based on a mean seed weight of 0.3 g and a mean seed volume of 0.32ml (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977); a maximum capacity of approximately 16.8 and 17.9 ml is suggested. Males tend to carry more seeds than females but the differences are not significant (p > .05). The Steller's Jay, like the Piiion Jay, transports seeds in its esophagus (distensible for approximately '/a its length). Histological preparations showed no elastic tissue and comparisons of gross morphology of the Steller's and Piiion Jay esophagi indicate no apparent differences. The mechanism of distensibility of the Steller's Jay esophagus is probably similar to that of the Pihon Jay, a simple relaxation of the esophageal muscles. This capability is less well developed however, as the Steller's Jay is capable of carrying fewer seeds. Observations at a feeding station of individuals that appeared to be carrying maximal loads indicate that the distensible esophagus can hold from 9 to 18 P. edulis seeds (X = 12.5, S.D. = 3.3, 11 = 22). A maximum capacity of 18 medium size P. edulis seeds is equivalent to 5.4 g and 5.8 ml. The Scrub Jay does not appear to have any specialized structures for carrying seeds. We have observed one to three P. edulis seeds being carried in the mouth and bill. MASTERS (unpubl. data) observed one to four ( j i = 1.4, Clark's Nutcracker carries seeds greater distances than any of the jays. The caching area of a population of nutcrackers on the San Francisco Mountains was 7.5 km from the nearest stand of pifion pine (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977) . This represents the minimum distance that pifion pine seeds must be carried for this population. The bulk of the pifion pine stand lies between 10 and 15 km from the seed-caching area and we often saw nutcrackers collecting seeds in this area. Nutcrackers have been observed collecting piiion pine seeds as far as 22 km from the nearest cache area (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977) . TOMBACK (1978) observed nutcrackers transporting whitebark pine seeds as far as 12.5 km. Nutcrackers appear to prefer harvesting seeds in areas nearest the caching area and travel greater distances as the seed crop nearest the cache area becomes depleted (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977) . Pifion Jays have been observed transporting seeds from the pifion-juniper woodland to their traditional breeding grounds in the ponderosa pine forest about 1 km away (BALDA and BATEMAN 1971) . Other populations of Pifion Jays in the San Francisco Mountains area have been observed carrying seeds at least 8 km and possibly further. In the Raft River Mountain, one of us (S.V.W.) has observed Piiion Jays transporting seeds from an isolated stand of P. monophylla to a cache area approximately 10 km away. Ten km appears to be the maximum distance that Piiion Jays transport seeds on these study areas, though typical distances range from 1 to 5 km. Few observations have been made of Steller's Jays transporting seeds. All observations of Steller's Jays foraging on pifion pines were made within 3 km of ponderosa pine forests, where individuals store seeds on their territories. Steller's Jays from the lower edge of the ponderosa pine forest are the only individuals that were observed participating in the pifion pine seed Frequencies a t which Scrub Jays were observed transporting piiion pine seeds The relationship between maximum quantity of seeds transported and the over given distances (n = 38) maximum distance seeds are transported for the four corvids. Line drawn by eye harvest. Three km appears to be the maximum distance Steller's Jays transport seeds. Scrub Jays collect seeds on or near their territories in the pifion-juniper woodland. Most Scrub Jays observed transporting seeds traveled less than 50 m, but a few individuals were observed flying as much as 500 m (Fig. 2) . In years of patchily distributed seed production, some individuals may leave their territories to collect seeds in neighboring areas and then transport them back to their territories up to 1 km away (F. F~T E L K A pers. comm.; pers. obs.). The maximum distance a species will travel to harvest seeds is correlated (r = 0.98) with the capacity of the seed-transporting structure (Fig. 3 ) . As will be demonstrated below, this relationship exists because the capacity of the food-transporting structure, along with specializations influencing flight speed, is an important determinant of the distance to which an individual can profitably travel to harvest seeds. The flight behavior of these corvids when transporting seeds varies markedly. Clark's Nutcrackers are bold, strong, direct fliers which frequently fly well above the forest canopy (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977) . In mountainous areas, nutcrackers seem to make use of winds and updrafts to gain lift (VANDER WALL et al. in press), a behavior which presumably reduces energy expended over long flights with heavy loads. Pifion Jays are also strong, direct fliers but usually fly through or just above the forest canopy (BALDA and BATEMAN 1971) . Both nutcrackers and Pifion Jays seldom stop to rest when transporting seeds. In contrast, Steller's and Scrub Jays are weak, slow fliers that frequently glide and move through the canopy secretively, stopping frequently. These differences in behavior are most easily quantified in terms of mean flight speed of seed-transporting individuals (Table 1) . Mean flight speed increases in the order: Scrub Jay, Steller's Jay, Picon Jay, Clark's Nutcracker, with all species significantly different except Picon Jays and Clark's Nutcrackers (F:i,6,, = 15.07, p < .05; Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test, p < .05). Flight speed is significantly correlated with mean bill length (r = 0.92, p < .05) and maximum quantity of seeds transported (r = 0.96, p < .05), relative measures of foraging and seed-transporting specialization, respectively. Nutcrackers and jays almost invariably cache seeds in the soil (GRINNELL 1936; BROWN 1963 b; TURCEK and KELSO 1968; BALDA and BATEMAN 1971; VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977; TOMBACK 1978 TOMBACK , 1980 but occasionally seeds are placed in cracks in rock outcroppings, crevices in tree trunks or clumps of dense foliage. Caches are made similarly by all four corvids. After an appropriate site is selected the bill is jabbed into the soil once or twice. This apparently serves to loosen the soil and may provide additional information on the nature of the substrate. One or more seeds are then cached by holding them, usually one at a time, in the tip of the bill and inserting them into the loosened soil. Seeds are usually cached at a depth of 1 to 3 cm. Three important differences in the caching behavior of these corvids are apparent: cache size, habitat in which seeds are cached and caching system (i.e. territorial or communal). The jays usually make one-seed caches but Clark's Nutcracker and, to a lesser extent, Piiion Jays make many caches containing more than one seed ( Table 2) . Size of caches made by nutcrackers reported here is very similar to those found by TOMBACK (1978: X = 4.2 * 2.9, n = 214 caches). Caches of small conifer seeds (e.g. ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir seeds) prepared by nutcrackers and Piiion Jays may be considerably larger than those of large conifer seeds shown in Seeds are cached in every major habitat occurring in the study areas. In the San Francisco Mountains, Clark's Nutcrackers transport piiion pine seeds to cache areas in the mixed coniferous forest (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977). S T E P H E N B. V A N D E R W Seeds are cached at elevations from 2525 to 2750 m, approximately 600 m higher than where the seeds were collected. The cache areas, steep southfacing slopes, lose their snow cover 1 to 2 months earlier than the adjacent north-facing slopes and during years of light snowfall may be free from snow intermittently during the winter. In the Raft River Mountains, piiion pine seeds are occasionally cached in the piiion-juniper woodland but more frequently they are transported to mixed coniferous forests, sagebrush slopes and mountain mahogany forests. Cache sites used most frequently are wind-swept ridges, south-facing slopes and cliff faces from 1825 to 2950 m elevation. Piiion Jays cache seeds in ponderosa pine forests and pifion-juniper woodlands, usually on the south side of trees, south-facing slopes and open windy areas, the first areas to lose their snow cover after a storm (BALDA and BATE-MAN 1971; LIGON 1978). Steller's Jays cache seeds in the ponderosa pine forest and Scrub Jays cache seeds in the pifion-juniper woodland. Both Scrub and Pifion Jays may carry seeds downslope into clearings (LIGON 1978 ; R.P.B. pers. obs.). Thus, each species caches seeds in different habitats, and at both study sites pifion pine seeds are cached in all major vegetation types. Clark's Nutcrackers and Pifion Jays cache seeds in \"communal\" cache areas (BALDA and BATEMAN 1971; VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977; LIGON 1978) . While Pifion Jay cache areas are on or near their traditional breeding grounds (BALDA and BATEMAN 1971) , nutcracker cache areas may be unassociated with breeding areas (MEWALDT 1956; VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977; TOMBACK 1978 ). On these areas many individuals intermix their caches with few aggressive interactions. However, the seed stores are not communal and usually, each individual recovers only the seeds it stores (but see VANDER WALL in prep.). Steller's and Scrub Jays cache seeds on their territories (BROWN 1963 a; MASTERS unpubl. data) and food stores are apparently shared only with the mate and young. The relative degree to which nutcrackers and jays are dependent on stored pine seeds can be determined by comparing four aspects of their behavior during the winter and breeding season: I. proportion of the diet composed of storcd pine seeds during the winter and early spring; 2. frequency and extent of eruptive movements during the fall and winter; 3. timing of the breeding season; and 4. proportion of the nestling diet composed of stored pine seeds. A. Winter Diet. Clark's Nutcrackers feed predominantly on conifer seeds with between SO and 100 % of their diet composed of seeds during November through February (GIUNTOLI and MEWALDT 1978) . The majority of the seeds eaten probably came from caches, as seeds in cones are usually depleted by October or November. Pifion Jays also rely heavily on cached pine seeds for winter food, taking between 70 and 9 0 % in their diet during the months of November through February (LIGON 1978) . N o data are available on the winter use of stored pine seeds by Steller's Jays and Scrub Jays but the extensive use of acorn mast during the winter in California (BEAL 1910) suggests that stored food is an important source of energy in the winter. The stomach contents of Steller's Jays during the months of November, December and January contained 76, 90 and 99 % acorn mast, respectively. For Scrub Jays the quantity of acorn mast consumed was: November, 66 %; December, 73 9%; January, 75 %; and February, 69 %. A high proportion of these acorns may have come from caches made the previous fall, since these birds store acorns industriously (GRINNELL 1936; BENT 1946; BROWN 1963 BROWN b, 1964 . Although generalizations concerning diets in different habitats should be treated with caution, these data suggest that stored pine seeds on our study areas may be used similarly. B. Eruptive Movements. The response of nutcrackers and jays to local or regional cone crop failure further indicates the importance 01 stored seed in the winter diet. At frequent intervals nutcrackers participate in large scale eruptions WILLIAMS 1957, 1964; BOCK and LEPTHIEN 1976; VANDER WALL et al. in press) where individuals or flocks invade prairies, deserts and Pacific coastal areas (American Ornithologists' Union 1957). These eruption movements are thought to be caused by one crop failure WILLIAMS 1957, 1964) . Pifion Jays also participate in these eruptions (HENDERSON 1920; American Ornithologists' Union 1957; WESTCOTT 1964). Steller's and Scrub Jays rarely erupt and the rarity of extralimital sightings suggest that movements are of a local nature (AIKEN and WARREN 1914; MAILLIARD 1927; WESTCOTT 1969) . WESTCOTT (1969) suggested that some Steller's and Scrub Jay movements are in response to factors other than cone crop failure. Differences in the degree to which these species participate in eruptive movements are reflected in their population structure. The agility of Clark's Nutcrackers and Piiion Jays has apparently resulted in frequent mixing of local populations. Consequently these species are monotypic and show little detectable geographic variation (MAYR and SHORT 1970) . Conversely, the more sedentary Steller's and Scrub Jays experience less mixing of local populations allowing greater adaptation to local environments. This has resulted in much geographic variation, with Steller's and Scrub jays having 6 and 12 recognized subspecies, respectively, in western North America (American Ornithologists' Union 1957). Thus, differences in population structure of Clark's Nutcracker and Pifion Jays on one hand and Steller's and Scrub Jays on the other may, in part, reflect differences in their dependence on conifer seeds. C. Timing of the Breeding Season. Nutcrackers and Piiion Jays are two of the earliest nesting passerines in North America, initiating breeding activities in February with egg laying beginning as early as late February and extending to early or mid April (SKINNER 1916; BRADBURY 1917; MEWALDT 1956; BALDA and BATEMAN 1973) . If the first nesting attempt fails, second or third attempts may extend into May and June (BALDA and BATEMAN 1971; BENT 1946). The early occurrence of nutcracker and Pifion Jay breeding is related to their food-storage habits (cf. VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977; LIGON 1978) . LIGON (1978) demonstrated that an ad libitum diet of piiion pine seeds accelerated gonadal development in captive Pifion Jays. BALDA and BATEMAN (1973) demonstrated that the time of breeding of Piiion Jays was not dependent on weather conditions just prior to nesting but on the size of the cone crop the previous fall. Large cone crops allow the Piiion Jay to store large amounts of pine seeds which presumably provides the energy for gonadal development and courtship, both of which occur under \"winter\" conditions, as well as a portion of the energy for nest building, egg laying and incubation (BALDA and BATEMAN 1973) . The relationship between breeding date and conifer seed availability has not been investigated for the nutcracker. However, conifer seeds comprise between 70 and 9 8 % of the nutcracker's diet with a frequency of 100% (n = 117 stomachs) during the months of March and April following years of seed production (GIUNTOLI and MEWALDT 1978) . The importance of conifer seeds in the nutcracker's diet at this time suggests that early breeding in Clark's Nutcracker is probably controlled by mechanisms similar to those found in Piiion Jays. The advantages of early breeding for both nutcrackers and Pifioii Jays appear to be increased time for young to gain weight and foraging experience before the onset of winter, resulting in increased survivorship of young (VANDER WALL and BALDA 1977; LIGON 1978 ). Steller's and Scrub Jays differ from the above species in that they breed much later with egg-laying occurring in April and May (JENSEN 1923; GRIN-NELL et al. 1930; BENT 1946; HARDY 1961) . Again, the spring diet of these two jays on the study area is unknown, but a parallel may be drawn from jays in other areas. I n California, Steller's Jay stomachs did not contain acorns during the month of May and acorn mast composed only 10% of the diet in June (no data for April, BEAL 1910). Scrub Jay stomachs contained 2 5 % acorn mast in April, less than 1 % in May and 2 % in June. The balance of the diets was composed primarily of insects. Again, caution is required when generalizing about coniferous forest jays but these data suggest that winter food stores are either depleted or not used in the spring when animal food becomes available. (LACK 1968; MORTON 1973) . Nestling Pifion Jays, by contrast, were fed less than 10 % conifer seeds following a bumper pifion pine cone crop (BATEMAN and BALDA 1973) . LIGON (1978) found that pifion pine seeds formed an important part of the nestling diet on an irregular basis, seeds being used most extensively when unfavorable environmental conditions precluded capture of insects. The diet of nestling Pifion Jays consists primarily of arthropods. Data are not available on the types of food fed to the young of Steller's and Scrub Jays on our study area but VERBEEK (1970) states that the food brought to young Scrub Jays is \"diverse\" and WHEELOCK (1904) states that young Steller's Jays are fed insects and berries.

      "Twin Cays, the second system studied (located 7 km north of Pelican Cays (16°4 9.4' N 88°6.1 ' W), consists of a shallow intertidal mangrove island characterized by a series of lagoons, channels, mud flats and ponds. The \"Lair\", the specific location where samples were taken, is a shallow lagoon (0.5 to 3 m deep) located at the end of The Lair channel. Though The Lair has a poorly developed sill, the <20 cm tide and long narrow Lair channel which separates The Lair from surrounding waters, help restrict water exchange with the surrounding waters. Overall water exchange, however, is greater than observed for Douglas Cay (Kibler et al., 2005) . The Lair is also high in organic matter originating from mangroves, meadows of turtle grass, Thalassia testudinium Bank ex Konin, as well as benthic production associated with the soft sediments. Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and irradiance were measured in the water column at three depths with a Yellow Spring Instrument profiling unit (model 6600). Irradiance was estimated by the integrating quantum scalar irradiance meter, Biospherical Instruments # QSI-140 meter (Tester et al., 2003) . Ammonia was measured fluorometrically using the method of Holmes et al. (1999) . Samples for chlorophyll a analysis were vacuum-filtered through 25mm GF/F filters (< 10 cm Hg) and were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were subsequently extracted with 7.5 ml 90% acetone and were macerated with a tissue grinder before being analyzed using the acidification method for chl a described by Parsons et al. (1984) . The water column conditions at Douglas Cay and The Lair were similar in . In 2004 we formally quantified stratification at each station using the Brunt-Vaisala frequency (N) . which describes the oscillation that results when the pycnocline is displaced (Mann and Lazier, 1996) . This metric was calculated at mid-depth in the water column using the expression N (rad s\" 1 ) = (g/ y7yz)' /: , where g is the gravitational constant (m s\" 2 ) and is density (Kg m\" 3 ). To simplify comparisons, N was converted to units of cycles h~' using N/2y. Strong stratification is indicated by frequencies in excess of 20 cycles, h\" 1 (Macintyre et al., 2002) .

      "This large sinkhole on the 'Ewa Plain of south-western O'ahu has preserved the richest Holocene assemblage of fossil birds known from the island (Olson & James, 1982) , with more than 30 species of native birds, notably including six songbird species with finch-like bills. Rhodacanthis litotes is represented by a single maxilla. Avian predators in the assemblage include the extinct O'ahu owl Grallistrix orion , a small harrier Circus dossenus , and an eagle ( Haliaeetus cf. albicilla ). Pollen spectra from a core of a former lake on the 'Ewa Plain record the presence of a mixed dry native forest with abundant pollen of Pritchardia (native palm), Dodonaea (native shrub), and Kanaloa (native leguminous shrub) in the second millennium bp , and a shift towards more open habitat during the first millennium bp (Athens et al ., 2002) . Pollen of koa is present, though not abundant, until roughly 500 years ago (estimated by interpolation). A rich Middle Pleistocene assemblage of fossil birds from ancient lake sediments in the crater of a tuff cone, on the Mokapu Peninsula of south-eastern O'ahu, includes more than 26 species of water birds, land birds, shore birds, and seabirds (James, 1987) . Among 10 species of songbirds, R. litotes is represented by a single maxilla. A hawk possibly allied with B. solitarius is abundant in the assemblage, and Grallistrix orion is common. A palaeoecological reconstruction based on habitat preferences of the birds in the assemblage suggests that, at the time of fossil deposition, the lake was surrounded by mixed lowland forest and scrubland with perhaps some areas of more open habitat such as herb land and grassland (Hearty et al ., 2005 ). This lava cave is the only fossil locality for koa-finches that is significantly above current sea level (James et al ., 1987) . The The site falls in the modern dry forest and shrubland zone, thought to have been particularly rich in native tree and shrub species before human-era disturbance. Koai'a is one of the characteristic native trees of the region (Medeiros et al ., 1986 ), and we project that the lower limit of the koa belt at first human Figure 2 The historical distribution of koa-finches (Banko, 1986) , and their estimated potential habitat on Hawai'i Island. Potential habitat is based on (1) the modelled distribution of plant communities expected to have significant amounts of koa and koai'a, and (2) areas expected to be less disturbed by human activity and introduced species. This distribution is estimated for three time periods (1) before human arrival c. 1300 years ago, (2) during the prehistoric Polynesian era, and (3) at present. contact reached nearly this elevation. The inferred age of the koa-finch fossils in Pu'u Naio Cave suggests that they were deposited during the middle Holocene wet period reported by Burney et al . (1995) . Koa may have been relatively abundant near the site at that time. Radiocarbon dating has not been performed directly on koa-finch fossils, but has been determined on other materials from the deposits. We report four new radiocarbon dates (those with laboratory numbers) and cite previously published dates that bracket the strata containing Rhodacanthis bones. A series of dates was determined on seeds, sediments, and bones of other species from the same stratigraphic units in Makauwahi Cave that produced the Rhodacanthis bones (Burney et al ., 2001 : Table 1 ). Eight determinations from unit IV of the east pit range from 5120 ± 50 to 4310 ± 60 years bp . Four determinations from unit V of the east pit range from 3670 ± 60 to 822 ± 60 years bp . Calibrated to calendar years, the entire series of dates ranges from 5987 to 667 cal years bp based on 95% confidence ranges of the individual dates. The koa-finch fossils are bracketed stratigraphically by two radiocarbon ages from the Pu'u Naio Cave deposit (James & Burney, 1997) . From the bottom of unit III (subunit I, grid W14.75 -15.00), a bone of an extinct flightless anatid ( Thambetochen chauliodous ) dated to 3858 ± 30 years bp (4157-4410 cal years bp , NZA 25637). From the bottom of unit IV in grid W-13, 98 cm below the sediment surface, a bone of an extinct flightless ibis ( Apteribis sp.) dated to 8220 ± 140 years bp (8773 -9515 cal years bp , AA-3090). Field notes for the specimen without provenance data indicate that it, too, originated in the stratigraphic layers that are bracketed by these dates. The fossil from Ulupau Head is Pleistocene in age (James, 1987) . It is bracketed by K/Ar age determinations on underlying lava from a neighbouring vent (450 ± 70 and 420 ± 45 kyr), and U-series ages on calcareous algae (240 ± 10/15 kyr) and corals (131.2 ± 0.4-115.4 ± 1.2 kyr) from overlying strata in the local section (Hearty et al ., 2005) . The fossil from the 'Ewa Plain is almost certainly Holocene in age. Four radiocarbon dates on bones from the site range from 3140 ± 60 years bp (3178-3310 cal years bp , AA-2975/87) for a moa-nalo bone ( Thambetochen xanion ), to modern (150 ± 50 years bp , AA-2974/87) for a bone of the Hawaiian short-eared owl ( Asio flammeus ). Twenty-three dates on extinct land bird bones from other, similar sites on the 'Ewa Plain range from 8840 to 1058 cal years bp (Athens et al ., 2002) . The sample consists of eight fossils representing a minimum of seven individuals, with one to three individuals per site. The sites where they occur have been among the most productive in the islands for fossils of songbirds. An inventory of passerine bones has been completed for two of the sites, and in both cases the most common passerine is a native thrush, genus Myadestes . The Makauwahi Cave collection (units IV and V) contains 32 identified specimens of M. palmeri compared with two of R. forfex , while the Pu'u Naio Cave collection (unit IV) contains 56 identified specimens of M. cf. lanaiensis compared with one of R. forfex and three of R. litotes .

      "We let the distance (nucleotide differences) found between two sequences be d and the mean expectation of that distance be [x -Lp k . The standard deviation of the distances is cr = -Pk)-Therefore, the number of standard deviations d is from expectation is s = (fi -d)/cr. The probability of a value as large as s can be found in any table of normal probability. The expected composition of nucleotide sets in the reconstructed ancestor comes from the same calculation, since i and j will lead, either by intersection or union, to a defined nucleotide set with a frequency fif/. If all the fif/ are summed according to the nucleotide set formed from i and j , one gets the expected distribution of nucleotide sets in the ancestor. It is important to determine this expected distribution since it, rather than the exact reconstructed composition, must be used to calculate further mutation probabilities when these reconstructed ancestors are considered as descendants from which still more remote ancestors are reconstructed. Because the sequences of the more remote ancestors are dependent upon the reconstruction of the sequences of less remote ancestors, expectations regarding the mutational differences of two remote ancestors must be similarly dependent. It should be noted that a change in the third coding position can never lead to more than one other amino acid being encoded. As might be suspected from Figure 1 , this procedure appears to be less sensitive in distinguishing convergence from divergence where there are only two (and sometimes but one) character states. Therefore, the following analyses were performed using only the first two of the three nucleotide positions in each codon. Also, the computer program at its present stage of development has serine represented as A or U in the first coding position and G or C in the second, with the consequence that cysteine, which is represented as U in the first and G in the second position, is not recognized as being one nucleotide replacement away. The statistical computations make proper allowance for this fact. To demonstrate that the statistical methods correctly predict the expected result when the sequences are truly unrelated, 16 independent sequences of 100 amino acids were assigned randomly to the tips of a tree whose structure (topology) was as if each line of descent from the ultimate ancestor successively divided exactly and symmetrically three more times. The statistical computation indicated that the two reconstructed penultimate ancestors would be expected to average 70.2 ± 6.8 mutations distant in the first and second coding nucleotides. Upon their reconstruction, they were found to be 77 mutations distant or (70.2 -77)/6.8 = -1.0 standard deviation from the mean expectation. Since approximately % of all random events fall within 1 cr of the mean expectation, the difference is not statistically significant and there is thus no evidence that the two groups of eight have any relationship-as indeed should be the case. Varying the number of the random sequences analyzed did not significantly affect the variation of the found distance about the mean expectation as shown by the circles in Figure 3 . Since it could be argued that the random assignment of these sequences to an a priori topology is unfair because in the normal case one first seeks out the best fitting tree for the sequence data, the 16 random sequences were also tested this way. The best tree is shown in Figure 4 . The number of species in the two groups being compared is shown on the x-axis. The y-axis shows the number of standard deviations, s, that a given result is from expectation. Wherever open symbols are used the species are divided equally between the two groups. The circles represent random sequences of amino acids (two unrelated groups of unrelated sequences), the triangles represent sequences from the convergent model (two unrelated groups of related sequences), and the squares represent known cytochromes c (two related groups of related sequences). The closed circle represents the random sequences calculated accordnig to the tree in Figure 4 . For the cytochromes, the set of two species is composed of man and saccharomyces iso-1. The set of four adds duck and saccharomyces iso-2 to the preceding group. The set of six adds tuna and Candida to the preceding group. The set of eight adds drosophila and debaromyces to the preceding group. The set of ten adds wheat and Neurospora to the preceding group. The set of 24 cytochromes c (closed square, species divided unequally) is composed of two groups of 5 fungal and 19 metazoan species as shown in Figure 5 . The closed triangle at 24 is for the set of similarly divided, convergent proteins as shown in Figure 6 . The closed triangle at 17 is a set of convergent proteins containing only FUB from the FUN group and 16 randomly selected sequences from the MET group. The axis on the right side of the figure gives the negative exponent of 10 (k) for the probability that by chance a result may be as It is clearly unlike the trees one usually obtains using real homologous sequences or even the artificial sequences that resulted from the model convergent process. What this tree essentially depicts is that every sequence is approximately equidistant from every other sequence. For this random model, it would be expected that the penultimate ancestors would average 71.0 ± 6.8 mutations distant in the first and second coding nucleotides. Upon their reconstruction by the above procedure, they were found to be 77 mutations distant or (71-77)/6.8 = 0.88 a. Since the initial random sequences are ~150 mutations distant while the reconstructed ancestors are only 77 mutations apart, there is the surface appearance of a divergent process. But since the calculation tells us that the reconstruction procedure would create this much apparent divergence (indeed a little more) we are in no danger of concluding that these random sequences are the result of a divergent evolution. This verifies once again that unrelated sequences lead to ancestral sequences whose mutation distance upon reconstruction by a carefully prescribed process can be reasonably estimated. Finally, to be certain that this result is due to the unrelatedness of the sequences rather than a randomness of the amino acids which might not be present in real protein sequences, the entire procedure many standard deviation units away from the mean as the corresponding values of s shown on the left side. The k are very nearly equidistant and are all the sums of consecutive numbers starting at 1 with the result that the n th number up is k = n(n + l ) / 2 . If n is set equal to 0.609 s and k calculated, then the probability of a value s & from the mean is 10~k. The probability value is precise for s = 1.644 (p = 10\" 1 ). At s = 7, p is calculated to be 6.62 X 10\" 12 when it is really 2.55 X 10~1 2 so the result is conservative. The relative error continues to increase as the probability decreases but the result is always conservative. Thus, we have a simple way of estimating p for large values of s in the absence of extensive tables for the normal distribution. Tree\" for Random Sequences of Amino Acids. Tree depicts the result when the computer was forced to \"discover\" the evolutionary relationships among 16 random sequences of 100 amino acids each. The \"% SD\" is only 3.4. All three codon nucleotide positions were used in formulating this tree. was repeated using the first 100 amino acids of 16 presumably unrelated proteins whose sequences have been determined. 2 The sequences were randomly assigned to the branch tips of a tree with the same topology as the first random case above. Calculation showed that the ancestors of the two groups of eight would be expected to be 71 mutations apart and were in fact 64 mutations distant or 1.07 standard deviation units from the mean, i.e., not significantly different from expectation. The statistical procedure is such that the nucleotide most frequent in two descendants is expected to be even more frequent in their immediate ancestor. This process, if continued through a sufficient number of ancestors, could conceivably cause some difficulty in estimating the mutation distance expected between the reconstructed \"ancestors\" of two very large unrelated groups of unrelated nucleotide sequences. The results with the random sequences, as shown in Figure 3 , fail to give any evidence that the present numbers of sequences cause any real difficulty. To demonstrate that proteins which evolved convergently are not given the appearance of having evolved divergently when the previously described method of ancestral sequence reconstruction is used, one could test the method on convergently evolved proteins. Since none of these are available, a model set of proteins was created, and the method tested on these. For this purpose it was decided that the general structure of their evolution should be as much as possible like the evolution of cytochrome c shown in Figure 5 . To this end, the fungal and metazoan portions of this tree were exactly reproduced in the convergent model but only in so far as the topology and the number of mutations on each descending leg is concerned. First of all, two ancestral genes called FUN and MET, 104 codons long, were obtained by random selection where each codon's probability of being selected was equal to its presumed frequency in the primordial cytochrome c gene. Using the sequence of human cytochrome c as the standard of fitness, potential mutations were randomly generated for various positions in the two sequences. Any mutation which would not increase the fitness of a sequence was not accepted. The general requirements of acceptability for a mutation were as follows. The new amino acid encoded as a result of a mutation and the previously encoded (old) amino acid were compared to the desired amino acid in that position of human cytochrome c. The following convergence rules for phenotypic convergence were used and the mutation, and therefore the new amino acid, was not accepted whenever: 1. the old amino acid was already identical to the desired amino acid; 2. the codon for the old amino acid was as few nucleotide replacements from the codon of the desired amino acid as was the new codon 3 ; 3 This rule number 2, unlike the others, selects at the level of the genotype rather than at the level of the phenotype. It was adopted solely to assure that the amount of convergence obtained per mutation accepted was maximized. When used, rules number 4 and 6 become redundant. The convergent model which produced the sequences compared in Figure 7 did not employ 3. the old amino acid was of the same polarity as the desired amino acid but the new amino acid was not (for this purpose, the non-polar amino acids were ala,cys,phe, ileu,leu,met,pro,trp,tyr, and val; the other ten were regarded as polar); 4. the old amino acid had the same charge as the desired amino acid but the new one did not 3 ; 5. the old amino acid was uncharged and polar, the desired amino acid was nonpolar but the new amino acid was charged; 6. the old amino acid was a member of the same subgroup as the desired amino acid but the new amino acid was not (the subgroups are A, tyr and phe; B, val, met, leu, and ileu; C, gly,ala and val; and D, ser and thr) 3 ; 7. the desired amino acid was polar, and the new amino acid was a larger non-polar amino acid than the old one (for this purpose, size was set as trp>tyr>phe>met> leu = ileu>val = pro>cys>ala); 8. the total charge on the molecule moved out of or away from the range of 10.5 ± 1 excess of positive over negative charges (his was given half a charge). Finally, for simplicity, it was decided not to permit a given nucleotide position to mutate more than once in the descent from an ancestor to its next immediate descendant and that while silent mutations (which don't change the amino acids encoded) were allowed, they were not counted among those mutations necessary to reach a descendant. Table I presents a general summary of the minimum mutation distances between the various proteins being considered in the convergent model. The original FUN and MET ancestral sequences were 156.5 rule 2 and hence convergence was more gradual. It was necessary to omit rule 2 in this case because the intent was to show that selection at the level of the phenotype leads to convergence at the level of the genotype. The tree is the best-fitting one found for the sequences 4 employed. All three codon nueleotide positions were used in formulating this tree. The number on the various legs indicate the number of nueleotide replacements assigned to that particular descent upon reconstruction of the ancestral sequences according to previously described rules (Fitch and Margoliash, 1967) . 1 The minimal mutation distance between the genes encoding two amino acid sequences is the minimum number of nucleotide differences that must be postulated to account for the observed differences in their sequence. The implication is that, since their common ancestor if they had one, this number of mutations or nucleotide replacements would have to have been fixed to explain their divergence. FUA -> E and MEF -> Y are the two major groups formed by the descent from the FUN and MET ancestral genes respectively. FUN and MET are names derived from a stretched analogy to fungi and metazoan ancestral cytochromes c which led to this model case. The ancestors, \"FU\" and \"ME,\" were reconstructed from the descendant species using the \"found\" phylogeny in Figure 6 and the reconstruction rules given in the text. Human cytochrome c is the \"standard\" of fitness toward which the FUN and MET ancestral sequences were made to evolve. The numbers in columns A and B are the average of 5 and 19 values respectively. Distances were calculated on the basis of all three coding positions. ± 4.5 nucleotide replacements distant from the human cytochrome c toward which they were to converge. This is almost exactly 1.5 mutations/coding position, which is about what one would expect from a pair of random proteins. The descendant sequences FUA through MEY average 121 mutations away from human cytochrome c. Thus, the true net convergence has amounted to about 35 nucleotide replacements, demonstrating that the model does produce convergence. However, the ancestral forms, FUN and MET, were initially only 149 mutations apart from each other (as opposed to their 156 replacements away from cytochrome c) and their descendants were still, on the average, 131.6 mutations apart from each other. This gives a relative convergence between the two groups of only 17 mutations. With real proteins it is unlikely that anything other than relative convergence would be observable. The convergent model proved interesting in part because the computer program, in attempting to reconstruct the phylogeny of the FUN and MET descendants, found a \"better\" tree than the actual tree. The \"% SD\" (standard deviation), which is an estimate of the error between the measured mutation distances between species and those distances computed for the tree under consideration, was 5.6% for the actual tree (see Fitch and Margoliash, 1967 for details). The error was reduced to 5.1% for the best fitting (or found) tree. Figure 6 shows a comparison between these two trees. The solid lines are identical for both trees. Where the trees differ, the structure of the actual tree is shown by dashed lines while the structure of the best-fitting found tree is shown by dotted lines. The found, rather than the actual, tree was used in reconstructing ancestral sequences because similar discrepancies must occur when using real protein sequences. The reconstructed ancestors of the convergent model prove to have only 117 mutations separating them in the first and second nucleotide positions, compared to 122 for the descendants, so that we have, seemingly, a small divergence where we know convergence has occurred. Thus, finding that the mutation distance between ancestral sequences reconstructed by the methods presented is less than the distance between the present day, descendant sequences is not sufficient to demonstrate the presence of an homologous relationship. The statistical calculation on the \"found\" tree of the convergent model indicates, assuming the sequences are all unrelated, The two random sequences, FUN and MET, were allowed to evolve according to the topology shown by the solid plus dashed lines (the actual tree) and under the rules given in the text for selection for convergence. Using all three coding nucleotides, the bestfitting tree was reconstructed according to previously described procedures (Fitch and Margoliash, 1967) . This found tree, where topologically identical to the actual tree, is shown by solid lines; where different, by dotted lines. The topology and the number of mutations accepted into each segment of the actual tree conforms to that for a set of 24 cytochromes c shown in Figure 5 . The mutation numbers at the nodal points are only those mutations in the first and second coding positions. The numbers represent those mutations occurring between the node at which the numbers appear and the two immediate descendants of that node. The number to the left of the slash is the number of mutations incorporated into the first two coding positions in the actual tree, the number to the right of the slash is the number of mutations discovered upon reconstruction by the present method. that the reconstructed FUN and MET ancestral sequences would be expected to average 54.1 ± 6.3 mutations distant in the first and second nucleotides. Reconstruction according to the procedure discussed in connection with Figure 2 finds them 117 mutations distant. This is (54-117) /6.3 = -9.95 standard deviation units from the mean expection. The probability of this result occurring by chance alone is less than 10~2 1 . The result is almost identical if the actual rather than the found tree is used. The triangles in Figure 3 show how the number of convergent proteins involved in the computation affects the calculation. No significant result was obtained until 10 species were included. However, as shown by the closed triangle, even 17 species is insufficient if one of the two groups contains only one species. There must be multiple representation in both groups to detect a significant relationship. It might be objected that our ability to detect convergence was dependent upon testing against each other two reconstructed ancestral sequences which were originally as remote as two random sequences. Dr. 107. The value of X 2 »PP is 3.94 for which the probability that this result could be a chance event is 0.048. The method for determining X 2 »PP has been submitted for publication. The two sequences are from a model case not otherwise discussed but which started with the same ancestral pair of sequences. More mutations were accepted, but since rule 2 regarding acceptability of mutations was omitted, the total amount of convergence was less than that of the convergent model in Figure 6 . M. Susman pointed out that if much of the convergence had already occurred prior to the point in time represented by the two ancestral forms being compared, the task would not be so easy. This is true, but the power of the method is indicated by eliminating species FUD through MEL from the data so that one is now reconstructing the ancestral forms only as far back as shown by the stars in Figure 6 . Thus over 50% of the net convergence in the two groups had occurred prior to the appearance of the two ancestral forms to be compared. Nevertheless, the convergence was detected with a probability that the result could de due to chance equal to 2 X 10~6 as shown by the star on Figure 3 . Such convergent sequences also provide an answer to the question asked earlier, i.e., might not the constraints on an optimal functional fitness be sufficiently severe that a convergent evolution will produce two analogous proteins which will appear related, not only chemically but by the criterion of genetic relatedness previously set forth. The answer is yes. Figure 7 shows a comparison between two sequences obtained in a convergent model which give the appearance of being homologous. The probability that this much similarity would occur by chance is less than .05 (Fitch, 1970b) . It required examination of an extraordinarily large length of sequence (60 amino acids) to detect this, but then greater convergence would have reduced the length required. The preceding computations show that when two sets of proteins have been caused to converge to somewhat similar chemical structures, the reconstructed ancestral sequences are less alike than would have been the case had all the presumed \"descendant\" sequences been in fact totally unrelated. What is the result when the same computations are performed for cytochrome c which has, presumably, the same number of mutations placed on the corresponding segments of a topology identical to the one used in the convergent model? The calculations were performed using 24 species and the tree shown in Figure 5 . The statistical calculation indicates, assuming the present day fungal and metazoan cytochromes are all unrelated, that the reconstructed ancestral sequences for the fungal and metazoan groups would be expected to average 63.4 ± 6.8 mutations distant in the first and second coding nucleotides. Reconstruction finds them only 21 mutations distant. This is (63.4-21)/6.8 = 6.3 standard deviations from the mean expectation. The probability of this result occurring by chance alone is less than 6 X 10~1 0 . Thus both convergent and divergent processes are shown to give statistically significant departures from the expectation and furthermore these departures are at opposite extremes of the distribution. It may appear to some that this procedure contradicts a basic philosophical principle that, given information on a system at only one point in time, one can not tell in which direction the system is moving in the time coordinate. The principle is sound, and it should be clearly recognized that my procedure can not distinguished between 24 cytochromes c which have diverged from a single ancestral gene and 24 independently arising cytochromes c which are converging on a single future descendant form. These are the pure forms of convergence and divergence and are identical except for a reversal of the time axis. As Dr. R. L. Metzenberg pointed out to me, what we have ruled out in the case of cytochrome c is a specific mixture of the two. And this can be done because the assumption of divergence permits (within limits) one to describe past states of the system knowing the present state (i.e., nucleotide sequences). Thus, if one accepts divergence for the genes within two select groups, say within the artiodactyl and carnivore hemoglobins, one can ask if their past states, which are describable under the a priori assumption of divergence, plus their present states are together consistent with the groups being convergent or divergent. This we can do because we now have character states at two points in time. The result is that we may show that the present-day sequences are consistent with pure divergence but not with mixtures of convergence and divergence, with a monophyletic origin but not with a biphyletic origin. One can maintain con-vergence in the cytochrome c gene as a logical possibility only by going all the way and assuming that there must have been a very large number of origins (perhaps as many as 24) to the 24 cytochromes c that were analyzed in this study. But if such a position is to be advocated, one must also explain how so many independently arising genes should have, by themselves, led to a phylogeny of these species ( Figure 5 ) which is so similar to the phylogeny biologists have produced using other characters. The explanation will become more tedious as other genes produce similar results until, like the geocentric view of the solar system, it collapses under the burden of epicycles of epicycles. It has been stated by Winter, Walsh and Neurath (1968) that \"The evolutionary biochemist . . . can show the similarity of two or more protein structures but he has not and cannot have any independent [internal] experimental evidence relating to the question of ancestral genes.

Brachypterous, small to medium size insects (from about 17 mm in the smallest males of Ch. borelli to about 31 mm in the largest females of Ch. bolivianus ). Body colour brown with dark brown postocular band extending on lateral lobes of pronotum and expanded behind the principal tranverse sulcus, pronotal lobes with lower mid half usually dirty white. Epimeron dirty white. Hind femur with the upper half of outer medial area dark brown, lower half of outer medial area dirty white. Head with large prominent eyes; fastigium with margins distinct but low; fastigio-facial angle rounded; frontal costa a little prominent between eyes. Pronotum subcylindrical, with prozona a little higher than metazona in lateral view, with deep transverse sulci; metazona much shorter than prozona; pronotal disk curving roundly into lateral lobes, without lateral carinae; medio-longitudinal carina only faintly indicated on metazona; posterior margin of pronotal disk rounded. Tegmina broadly ovate, short, barely reaching the second abdominal tergite; broad at the base and with straight distal margin. Veins of tegmina strongly impressed. Hind femora robust. Ovipositor valves short, dorsal valves upcurved. Male subgenital plate with rounded apex. Male cerci curved inwards in acute angle, distal half lamelliform.

In openings of dry forest with palm trees in the dry 'Chiquitano' forest (Navarro & Maldonado 2002) in the transition between the 'Chaqueño' and Amazonian biogeographical provinces (Cabrera & Willink 1973) in Bolivia (Fig. 7) . The phylogenetic analysis conducted in this study showed that Chlorus is a monophyletic genus. The inclusion in the analysis of species that represent the generic group where Chlorus is classified helped to define the monophyletic status of the genus. Within the genus, two clades were depicted based on characters from the external morphology. Chlorus borellii showed to be the 'basal' and most divergent species of the genus. Differences among the species of each group are mostly based on the colour of hind legs and the shape of male cerci and male genitalia. The analysis also showed that the relationships of Chlorus to its closest genus were not solved. If characters from the external morphology are considered, Chlorus is more related to Dichromatos. On the other hand, if characters from the male genitalia are considered, Chlorus is related to Eurotettix. Because morphological characters showed not to be enough to resolve genera level relationships, molecular data, of a completely independent marker, not associated with morphological changes (e.g., mtDNA) should be used to discriminate between the two hypotheses. Within the South American Melanoplinae, the tribe Dichroplini is the most diversified group (23 genera and 132 species). The taxonomic diversity within the tribe Dichroplini is accompanied by great morphological uniformity, except in the divergent male genitalia. Genitalia are not universally highly divergent in grasshoppers. In many large groups they are rather uniform and not useful for distinguishing species. Their divergence in the Melanoplinae appears to be associated with the mode of courtship -or rather the almost complete lack of precontact courtship -females are unaware of males until they have been jumped on (Otte 1976) . At this point tactile stimuli appear to assume great importance (Otte 1976) . Historically, diversification of mating structures has been attributed to selection for prezygotic isolation mechanisms that prevent hybridisation. The reproductive isolation hypothesis has two main predictions. First, if the diversification of mating structures results from selection for reproductive isolation, there should be species-specific fits of male and female mating structures. Second, there should be more diversification of mating structures in sympatry than in allopatry. A few systems are consistent with these predictions (Eberhard 1985) . However, there are many systems for which there is no evident species-specific fit between male and female mating structures; in these species, female structures do not prevent intromission by males of other species (Eberhard 1985) . Such seems to be the case in Chlorus species, where there is an apparent absence of corresponding female genitalic specificity; certainly they appear to be much more similar to one another than males. Eberhard (1996) also argued that genitalic differences evolve outside the context of reproductive isolation and that diversity of male genitalia is shaped by cryptic female choice. If Chlorus females can judge male performance by postcopulatory courtship, Eberhard's argument holds consistent. Taxonomists and ecologists (Lockwood 1989 (Lockwood , 1996 Cohn 1994 ) have debated the value of genitalic differences in insect systematics using this same complex of grasshoppers (Melanoplinae) to make their points. Lockwood (1989 Lockwood ( , 1996 considered that genitalia may have low utility, while Cohn (1994) defended the position that without them grasshopper taxonomy can go nowhere. Whether the diversification of mating structures observed in Chlorus results from selection from reproductive isolation or is a result of sexual selection is out of the scope of this study. However, the differences found in the characteristics of the male genitalia among the new species of Chlorus are equivalent to those found in most of the species of Dichroplini and we believe they justify the description of these new taxa. Chlorus belongs together with Eurotettix, Dichromatos, Atrachelacris, Scotussa, Leiotettix and Ronderosia to the group of genera referred to as 'Paranense-Pampeano' (Ronderos & Cigliano 1990) . Following Cabrera & Willink (1973) biogeographical scheme the group is distributed in the following provinces of the Neotropical Region: Pampas, Chaqueño (Chacoan province of Morrone 2006) , Cerrado, Yungas, Paranense (Cerrado, Parana Forest, Yungas, and Araucaria angustifolia Forest of Morrone 2006) . Chlorus shows some biogeographical overlap with its closest genera, Eurotettix and Dichromatos, but has a wider distribution being present also in the Yungas and Chaqueño provinces. The greatest diversity of Eurotettix is recorded from the Cerrado and Paranense biogeographical provinces in southcentral Brazil and southcentral Paraguay, while Dichromatos is mostly represented in the Paranense biogeographical province in south-eastern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and north-eastern Argentina. The Cerrado formation is characterised by low open forests with thick understory of bushes and thick gramineous strata with tall weeds. While the vegetation of the Paranense province is characterised by tropical forest, some tall grass savannas and some scattered Araucaria forests found on the Brazilian planalto and north-eastern Argentina corresponding to the biogeographical province of A. angustifolia forest (following Morrone 2006′s biogeographical scheme) that occur at an altitude between 600 and 1800 m. The greatest diversity of Chlorus is western to the distribution of the other two genera, reaching the Yungas province of Bolivia. Within the genus the most basal species, Ch. borellii is distributed in the Chaqueño and Paranense biogegraphic provinces. One of the clades depicted within the genus (Ch. vittatus, Ch. attenuatus, Ch. brunneus) is distributed in the Paranense and Cerrado provinces of Paraguay and Brazil, and the other one (Ch. spatulus, Ch. chiquitensis, Ch. bolivianus) is present in the Yungas and the Chaqueño provinces (mostly in the 'Chiquitano' arid forest of Navarro & Maldonado 2002) . The Yungas is characterised by a cloudy forest that can reach altitudes between 1700 and 2500 m in the Andes. The Chaqueño (= Chacoan of Morrone 2006) subregion is closely related to the Amazonian and Parana subregions. The development of the Chacoan subregion during the Tertiary split the former continuous Amazonian-Parana forest, representing an example of dynamic vicariance (Morrone 2006) . Certain insect taxa reflect the Amazonian-Paranense disjunction while others, which probably evolved later, are found in both the Chacoan and Paranense subregions (Morrone 2006) , such would be the example of the basal species of Chlorus (Ch. borellii). A phylogeographical analysis of small mammal species showed that central Brazil gallery and dry forests play an important role as present and past habitats for forest species from the Amazonian and Parana subregions. Population of Chaqueño mammals have their closest relatives in the Amazonian subregion, in the Parana subregion, or are basal to both regions (Morrone 2006) . , 2007, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1463-6409.2007.00274.x by University Of Michigan Library, Wiley Online Library on [21/10/2022].

Although C. appendiculatus was originally distinguished from C. undecimalis mainly by the presence of gas-bladder appendages, this character is now known to be variable (Meek and Hildebrand, 1925) . These appendages are present in some specimens and reduced or obsolete in others. The other differences given are clearly ontogenetic. Contrary to Poey's usual procedure, the original description of C. appendiculatus is not based on a designated single specimen. Three individuals, 400, 600 and 900 mm TL, are mentioned, but only in relation to body depth and eye diameter. Howell-Rivero (1938) stated that a specimen 230 mm TL (MCZ 10274), another 330 mm TL (MCZ 10306) and a disarticulated skeleton of a specimen about 540 mm TL (MCZ 34156) are \"cotypes\" of C. The holotype of C. argenteus, 93 mm SL (BMNH 1862.12.15.80) , is a juvenile C. undecimalis. This nominal species had been previously synonymized with C. undecimalis by Regan (1907) himself. Type.-The holotype is a specimen 160 mm SL (ZMB 38). Presumbly, this is the specimen used by Bloch for the original description and figure (H.-J. Paepke, pers. cor.). Remarks.-There are no diagnostic characters in the original description whereby the species can be recognized. The figure, however, shows the second and third anal spines with the correct relative length for the species usually recognized as C. undecimalis. The nomenclatorial status of this species was definitely established by Chavez (1961) Distribution (Fig. 6 ). are modally nine dorsal-fin rays in those referable to C. viridis and modally 10 in those referable to C. nigrescens. Also, the specimens of C. viridis have usually 10 or 11 nonrudimentary lower limb gill rakers but those of C. nigrescens usually have only eight or nine, a much wider interorbital and a shorter second anal spine. The holotype confirms the character states just given for C. nigrescens and the narrower interorbital and longer anal spine in C. viridis agrees with its original description. Apparently for the reasons given above, Boulenger (1895), Gilbert and Starks (1904) and Distribution (Fig. 9) 'O 100 .90 I80 7' --0 40 Types. Remarks. -Greenfield (1975) in reporting three specimens from Belize as C. poeyi gave counts that apply to C. undecimalis rather than to C. poeyi. I refer in particular to the eight or nine lower limb nonrudimentary gill rakers (11 or 12 in C. poeyi), the 69-71 lateral scales (73-80 This content downloaded from 35.7.8.208 on Mon, 24 Oct 2022 22:30:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms in C. poeyi) and the 15 or 16 pectoral-fin rays (modally 16 in C. poeyi). As to the six anal rays, third spine longer than second and pelvic fin not reaching to anus, these character states are common to both C. undecimalis and C. poeyi. Greenfield did not mention the number of dorsal-fin rays which is modally 10 in C. undecimalis and nine in C. poeyi. This character state alone distinguishes these two species. Subsequent to publication the reprints mailed out by Greenfield bear the following added statement; \"The recent collection of a large series of C. undecimalis from Honduras has suggested that individuals of less than 140 mm SL will key to C. poeyi casting doubt on the status of C. poeyi in Belize.

      "They eat all kinds of dicot fruits, their favorites are këku [ Cebids include night monkeys (Aotinae); capuchins and squirrel monkeys (Cebinae); and a distinctive clade of small, clawed species that includes Goeldi's monkey, marmosets, and tamarins (Callitrichinae). Eight cebid species in six genera are definitely known to occur in the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve. Subfamily Aotinae Elliot, 1913 Night (or owl) monkeys comprise eight currently recognized species in a single genus (Aotus) that ranges from Panama to northern Argentina (Groves, 2005) . Seldom seen by day, and hard to see at night due to their weak eyeshine, night monkeys are more frequently detected by their distinctive vocalizations. Unfortunately, the taxonomy of night monkeys has never been comprehensively revised, and many questions of identification remain. In the absence of reliable criteria for field identification, night monkey identifications are usually justified by making assumptions about geographic range limits. Our attempt to identify collected specimens of night monkeys from the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve, however, suggests that the current taxonomy is itself based on inadequately documented distributional assumptions.

(Note that some early reports of night monkeys from the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve identified the local species as Aotus trivirgatus; see below.) IDENTIFICATION: Night monkeys exhibit a limited range of phenotypic variation, mostly in pelage traits, and all of the named forms in this genus were once considered to belong to a single geographically variable species, Aotus trivirgatus (see Hershkovitz, 1949; Cabrera, 1958) . However, subsequent karyotypic research by R.A. Brumback and N.S.F. Ma (reviewed by Hershkovitz, 1983) revealed unexpected geographic variation in diploid numbers (2n) and fundamental numbers (FN) that they interpreted as evidence for multiple species. The hypothesis that at least some night monkey karyomorphs represent valid taxa is supported by a variety of data, including correlated pelage traits, comparative serology, and clinical responses to experimental infection with malaria parasites (Hershkovitz, 1983) ; evidence of sympatry without apparent hybridization in the wild (Pieczarka et al., 1992) ; substantial mtDNA sequence divergence (Ashley and Vaughn, 1995; Plautz et al., 2009; Menezes et al., 2010) ; and reduced fertility in at least some hybrid pairings (Kumamoto and Houck, 2001 ). Together, these and other results (Ford, 1994; Defler and Bueno, 2007) effectively refute earlier notions that Aotus is monotypic, but many taxonomic issues remain unresolved. The most frequently cited phenotypic character in the recent literature on Aotus concerns the coloration of the fur of the neck. The so-called ''red-necked'' and ''graynecked'' phenotypes are defined by the presence or absence, respectively, of a lateral extension of the reddish ventral coloration along the neck below and behind the ear (Hershkovitz, 1983: fig. 1 ). Allegedly, the gray-necked forms of Aotus (for which the oldest available name is trivirgatus Humboldt, 1811) occur north of the Amazon, and red-necked forms (for which the oldest available name is azarae Humboldt, 1811) occur south of the Amazon, but Hershkovitz (1983) discussed some exceptions to this geographic pattern and others are indicated by specimens that we examined (see below). Although neck coloration is commonly used as the basis for recognizing species groups of Aotus (e.g., by Hershkovitz, 1983; Ford, 1994; Groves, 2001 ), recent sequencing studies do not support the reciprocal monophyly of gray-necked and red-necked night monkeys (Plautz et al., 2009; Menezes et al., 2010) . The original description of Aotus nancymaae was largely justified on the basis of karyotypic data, but no morphological voucher material of known geographic origin is apparently available for any chromosomal preparation attributed to this species, and existing vouchers of karyotyped laboratory animals do not consistently exhibit diagnostic pelage traits. 7 Instead, only indirect evidence is available to correlate chromosomes with phenotypes. According to Hershkovitz (1983) , unvouchered night monkey karyotypes prepared by N.S.F. Ma from blood samples obtained at Peruvian localities on the south (right) bank of the Amazon (including the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve) all have 54 chromosomes and 72 autosomal arms (2n 5 54, FN 5 72), whereas most karyotypes from the north (left) bank of the Peruvian Amazon have 2n 5 46 and FN 5 60. Hershkovitz (1983) attributed divergent pelage traits to these karyotypes by examining skins from north-bank and south-bank Peruvian localities. He identified the north-bank 2n 5 46 karyotype as belonging to the gray-necked species Aotus vociferans (Spix, 1823), and he described a new species of red-necked night monkey, A. nancymaae (originally misspelled nancymai; see Groves, 2001 ) for the southbank 2n 5 54 karyotype. However, an allegedly unique enclave of red-necked night monkeys with 2n 5 54 chromosomes (also referred to A. nancymaae) occurs along the lower Río Tigre, a north-bank tributary of the Amazon (Hershkovitz, 1983: fig. 9 ). 7 Of the two karyotypic vouchers of Aotus nancymaae mentioned by Hershkovitz, one (FMNH 123033 5 Brumback lab #103) is unambiguously red necked, but the other (FMNH 123032 5 Brumback lab #102) appears to be gray necked. Although Hershkovitz (1983: 228) said that these specimens were from ''the series described by Brumback et al. (1971) ,'' the FMNH mammal catalog states they originated from the Johns Hopkins Hospital Primate Colony, whereas Brumback et al.'s (1971) material came from other institutions. Instead, FMNH 123032 and 123033 are probably two of the three Johns Hopkins specimens karyotyped by Brumback (1973) , who said they were collected in ''the Leticia, Colombia-Iquitos, Peru area of the Amazon Basin south [sic] of the Andes mountains'' (op. cit.: 285).

IDENTIFICATION: Saki monkeys from the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve were referred to Pithecia hirsuta by Hershkovitz (1979) , but subsequent study of type material led Hershkovitz (1987c) to identify the same specimens as P. monachus. Although all of our material is referable to P. monachus as that taxon was briefly distinguished in Hershkovitz's (1987c) key, the taxonomic significance of phenotypic variation among western Amazonian populations of sakis remains to be convincingly established. Because our series from Nuevo San Juan (N 5 26 adult specimens) is the largest sample available to document morphological variation within a local population of any Pithecia species, we provide a detailed description below. The 11 adult male skins from the Río Gá lvez exhibit limited variation in pelage characters. The dorsal body pelage and the pelage of the outer surfaces of the arms and legs is predominantly blackish, but the individual hairs have pale tips that produce a frosted mass effect; specimens with long, whitish hair tips (e.g., MUSM 11126) appear more heavily frosted than individuals with shorter, yellowish, or brownish terminal bands (MUSM 11142). The distinctive ruff or mane surrounding the head does not contrast in coloration with the rest of the body fur. The hands are distinctly paler than the arms, appearing whitish in most individuals, but the bases of the individual hairs on the hands are always dark. Most specimens also have whitish feet, but a few (e.g., MUSM 11128, 11129, 11145) have grizzled pedal fur that is not conspicuously paler than the fur of the thigh and shank. Whereas the body pelage is long and lax, especially over the shoulders and nape (60-100 mm), the coronal pelage (from between the ears to the brow line) is abruptly shorter (,10 mm) and stiffer, forming a dense mat; the cheeks are densely and more or less uniformly covered by hairs that are similar in length and texture to those of the coronal pelage. This pelage of the crown and cheeks is also abruptly paler than the body fur, ranging in mass effect from whitish to yellowish or brownish gray; the individual facial hairs always have dark bases and/or dark tips, however, so even the palest faces appear finely grizzled on close inspection. The muzzle is more sparsely haired than the cheeks and crown, and the exposed skin is blackish; a small patch of blackish skin is also exposed on the center of the forehead just above the brow line in most specimens. The throat is naked and glandular, but the chest has a prominent patch of long, pale-tipped fur; the abdominal pelage is sparse and uniformly black. The female pelage is similar to the male condition, with a few exceptions. The most obvious difference is that the transition from the long, lax nuchal fur to the shorter fur of the head is not abrupt as it is in males; instead, the cranial hairs gradually decrease in length and increase in stiffness from occiput to forehead. The coronal pelage of females is also much more chromatically variable than that of males, with some females having conspicuously pale (whitish or beige) crowns and foreheads whereas others have much darker (brownish) cranial fur; the individuals with the palest (MUSM 11141) and the darkest (MUSM 11136) cranial fur in our series are both young adults as judged by tooth wear. Although the throat of females is mostly bare, the exposed gular skin is less obviously glandular than it is in males. The pectoral tuft of long, paletipped fur is also less well developed in females than it is in males. Head-and-body length and several osteological measurements show strong sexual dimorphism in our sample (table 15) . In general, the craniodental pattern is typical of that seen in most primates (Schultz, 1962) with dimorphism in the facial skull (rostrum, orbits, zygoma) and the canine teeth versus monomorphism in the braincase and postcanine dentition. Three qualitative cranial traits exhibit marked variation in our sample, which we analyzed for association with age (''young'' adults versus ''old'' adults, as determined by toothwear and basicranial suture closure) and sex using Fisher's exact test. (1) The sagittal crest (coded as present or absent) is highly significantly associated with sex and with age (p % 0.01 for both tests), being present only in males and more frequently in old adults than in young adults. (2) The mesopterygoid fossa is quite variable in its anterior extent, terminating behind the toothrows in some individuals (e.g., AMNH 268244, MUSM 11145) and penetrating Summary statistics (mean plus or minus one standard deviation, observed range in parentheses, and sample size) for measurements and weights of AMNH 268241, 268244; MUSM 11126, 11128-11133, 11138, 11142, 11145, 11147, 11149, b Summary statistics (mean plus or minus one standard deviation, observed range in parentheses, and sample size) for measurements and weights of AMNH 268243; MUSM 11127, 11136, 11140, 11141, 11146, 11148, 11150, 11151, 11153, 11154. deeply between the molars in others (MUSM 11127, 11128) , apparently independently of age and sex. 3The pterygoid fossae are shallow and unenclosed by bone in most individuals but more deeply excavated in others (MUSM 11133, 11142, 11145) , variation that also appears to be unassociated with age or sex. In qualitative cranial characters, the Río Gá lvez sakis all agree with Hershkovitz's (1987c: table IV) diagnosis of the Pithecia monachus group, an assemblage that includes P. aequatorialis, P. albicans, P. irrorata, and P. monachus. According to Hershkovitz, taxa within this group are distinguishable only by pelage traits. In the comparative material we examined, the distinguishing external characters of all the saki species recognized by Hershkovitz are readily apparent, at least in adult males; by his classification, our vouchers are unambiguously referable to P. monachus. By contrast, P. irrorata (which occurs south of the Amazon between the Juruá and the Tapajó s; Hershkovitz, 1987c) has an almostnaked head, the exposed blackish skin of which is conspicuously set off by an encircling white-fringed ruff. Another geographically adjacent form, P. aequatorialis (which occurs north of the Amazon between the Tigre and the Napo; Bravo and Ríos, 2007; Aquino et al., 2009) has long reddish or red-based fur on the cheeks (resembling the mutton-chop whiskers of 19th-century gentlemen) and a conspicuously reddish chest. Pending a comprehensive analysis of character variation in the monachus group, these and other character differences seem sufficient to maintain the nominal taxa recognized by Hershkovitz as distinct, but whether or not these should be recognized as full species remains to be convincingly demonstrated. 15 In the event that a trinomi-al classification is judged to better represent the situation, our material from Nuevo San Juan would be referable to the nominotypical form P. monachus monachus. ETHNOBIOLOGY: Saki monkeys are called bëşhuidkid, a term that is perhaps etymologically analyzable as meaning ''white-faced one.'' Two subtypes are recognized by the Matses: mamu (with no meaning in Matses, but in closely related languages it means ''pitch,'' a black adhesive made of beeswax and tree latex) and bëshudu (not analyzable, except possibly the prefix bë-''face/forehead''). The mamu variety is said to be larger, have a whiter face, whiter hands, and a bushier coat, while the bëshudu variety is said to be smaller, to have a black or darker face, less white on its hands and a thinner coat. Troops of mamu are said to be found more frequently in upland habitats far from large rivers, and bëshudu more frequently along rivers. A minority of Matses hunters do not recognize two varieties and consider mamu and bëshudu to be synonyms of bëşhuidkid. Fleck et al. (1999) discussed this ethnobiological issue in detail and summarized morphological and genetic evidence that the Matses overdifferentiate saki monkeys. All Matses eat sakis. As with other monkeys, sakis are cooked by first singing the hair off and then boiling them; likewise, men cannot eat or touch the intestines. Children usually eat the head. The Matses believe that if they give a dog a saki monkey bone, the dog will die; therefore, they are always mindful of this when disposing of the bones. The Matses hunt saki monkeys by listening for their grunts and calls or the noise they make rustling branches as they move through the trees, or by looking for their dropped half-eaten fruits. When a hunter with dogs encounters saki monkeys and the monkeys do not see him, he imitates their raptorwarning call, upon which all the monkeys drop to the ground. The hunter then looses his dogs, which chase the monkeys down as they run away. Hunters also run after monkeys on the ground and club them or slam them against a tree when they catch them. (Saki monkeys will bite and sometimes even kill dogs that are trying to catch them. They will also bite people, if they are not 15 A preliminary morphometric study (Marroig and Cheverud, 2004) suggested that at least some species of western Amazonian sakis are osteologically differentiated, but sample sizes were small (e.g., N 5 1 for Pithecia aequatorialis). No taxonomic study of DNA sequence variation in the genus has been published to date. Bravo and Ríos (2007) reported what appeared to be mixed-species groups of sakis (including both P. aequatorialis and P. monachus) at three inventory sites and emphasized the need for new morphological and genetic research to assess the taxonomic status of these forms. careful when grabbing them.) If saki monkeys are familiar with this trick, they will not drop to the ground when a hunter imitates their raptor-warning call. Now that most Matses are using shotguns, hunters without dogs will often ignore saki monkeys early in the hunt because the amount of meat they have is hardly worth a shell. Likewise, if hunters have dogs but the saki monkeys will not drop to the ground, hunters will probably not shoot at them early in the hunt. If hunters encounter sakis on the way back from an unsuccessful hunt, however, they will often shoot. Sakis in trees are shot from the ground with arrows or shotguns. When they see people, sakis will not drop to the ground but run away very fast over the tops of branches and jumping from tree to tree. Hunters may chase one down until it gets tired and then shoot it (the Matses do not usually shoot at moving targets). Sometimes a hunter will climb a tree to kill a tired-out saki monkey that he cannot shoot from the ground, but the monkey may evade the hunter by dropping to the ground and running off. MATSES NATURAL HISTORY: Saki monkeys have a lot of hair. Their bodies are actually small, but they look big because of all the hair. Their coats look like their hair has started to go gray, like an old person's hair. Their faces and hands are white. The tail is furry and looks big, but it does not have much meat on it and cannot be used to grab onto things. Their head hair is also long, but not on the forehead. They are strong and run very fast through the trees without falling down. They run fast on the ground as well. They run fast even with their young on their backs. Saki monkeys can drop to the ground without hurting themselves. Saki monkeys are found in all types of habitats, in upland forest and floodplain forest, in primary forest and in blowdowns. They travel high or low in the trees. They are found in small troops, fewer than 10 animals, or sometimes alone. The troop usually stays together to travel, feed, and sleep, though occasionally they split up to search for food. Saki monkeys wake up just before dawn. When they wake up in the morning they go ''she she she aa aa aa.'' When they see a jaguar, they say ''waa waa waa.'' Sometimes they feed in the same tree with woolly or uakari monkeys. The whole troop sleeps in the same tree, wherever they are when night falls [i.e., they Primates comprise less than 10% of the mammalian species known to inhabit the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve, so it is premature to draw any general conclusions about the local fauna, or about the Matses' knowledge of its natural history, from such a small sample. Additionally, most primates are relatively large, eurytopic, highly mobile, visually oriented, social, diurnal, frugivorous, and arboreal. The extent to which this unique ensemble of ecobehavioral traits may have influenced primate biogeography, our ability (as taxonomists) to detect phenotypic differ-ences among primate taxa, or the Matses' ability (as hunters) to learn primate habits is unknown, but it seems unlikely that valid inferences about the entire mammalian fauna can be based on information summarized above. Therefore, we restrict the following discussion to primatological topics and defer broader generalizations to subsequent reports. Available information about primate diversity in the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve is based on 225 examined specimens collected at eight different localities and published sight records from another 16 localities. Although we are unable to analyze these aggregate data (obtained over many years using different methods) to statistically assess inventory completeness, the 600+ hours that Fleck spent hunting with the Matses at Nuevo San Juan and impressive faunal-sampling effort at several other localities (table 16) suggest that few (if any) additional primate species remain to be discovered in the region. Nevertheless, unconfirmed reports of other taxa (e.g., Saimiri boliviensis and Aotus nigriceps in the Reserva Comunal Tamshiyaco-Tahuayo; Puertas and Bodmer, 1993) merit the attention of future researchers, who should collect specimens to voucher any new records. The 14 primate species definitely known to occur in the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve are sympatric at Nuevo San Juan and may eventually be found together elsewhere, but short-term inventories have found fewer species at most sites. One species (Callimico goeldii) is rare, and another (Cacajao calvus) is migratory and patchily distributed, so many local primate communities probably consist of only 12 ecologically interacting species, and some sites with unusual habitats may have even fewer. The white-sand forests of the upper Gá lvez/Río Blanco, for example, seem likely to have relatively depauperate primate faunas; only eight species were recorded at the single surveyed site in this habitat (Amanzo, 2006) . The primate fauna that occurs between the Yavarí and the Ucayali resembles those of adjacent interfluvial regions in some respects but differs in others (table 17) . All of these western Amazonian faunas share a core assemblage of six widespread species that include Alouatta seniculus, Lagothrix lagothricha, Callithrix pygmaea, Cebus albifrons, Cebus apella, and Pithecia monachus. A seventh widespread species, Ateles belzebuth, is (inexplicably) absent only in the Napo-Putumayo interfluve. Other shared taxa include Aotus and Saimiri, which are represented in each region by geographically replacing species. Each region also has at least one member of the Saguinus nigricollis group (sensu Hershkovitz, 1977; including S. fuscicollis) and one member of the Callicebus cupreus group (sensu Roosmalen et al., 2002; including C. discolor). By contrast, other primate taxa have more restricted distributions: Saguinus mystax (which belongs to a different species group than S. fuscicollis and S. nigricollis) and Cacajao calvus are only found south of the Marañ ó n/Amazon, members of the Callicebus torquatus group (sensu Roosmalen et al., 2002: including C. lucifer and C. regulus) do not occur between the Yavarí and the Marañ ó n, and Pithecia aequatorialis only occurs between the Mar-añ ó n and the Napo. Callimico goeldii has a poorly documented distribution; in northeastern Peru it is only known to occur in the Yavarí-Ucayali, Ucayali-Marañ ó n, and Marañ ó n-Napo interfluves. As a consequence of these distributional phenomena, the primate fauna of the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve is unique, conspicuously differing from faunas on the north bank of the Marañó n/Amazon by having uakaris and two sympatric species of tamarins, and from adjacent south-bank faunas east of the Yavarí by lacking collared titis (species of the Callithrix torquatus complex). The primate fauna of the Yavarí-Ucayali interfluve is most similar to In the absence of any existing convention for naming Amazonian interfluvial regions, we do so counterclockwise from the southeast (see figure 1) .

Awareness of other potential factors that influence the panmictic stock has also increased, including the potential effects of disease, exotic parasites, pollution, habitat reduction and fragmentation, impacts from dams and hydroelectric facilities, and changes in the oceanic environment (Castonguay et al. 1994b) . Similar declines in the population of European and Japanese eels have been observed, with comparable suspected sources of impacts (Moriarty and Dekker 1997; Tatsukawa and Matsumiya 1999) . In this article we review the evidence for a continent-wide decline in abundance of the American eel, factors that may be contributing to this decline, and the needs for future regulation, research, and monitoring. While the recent declines in reported commercial landings noted above have contributed to the increasing concern about the status of the American eel, these aggregated annual landings data are of very limited value for characterizing abundance trends or exploring factors influencing those trends. Data on landings and fishing effort are known to be incomplete or nonexistent, with evidence of underreporting of catch by as much as 70% in some states (EPRI1999). The extensive harvest of young yellow-phase eels for use as crab bait in the Chesapeake Bay region and as live bait for recreational fisheries for species such as striped bass {Morone saxatilis) in New England and the Mid-Atlantic region are additional sources of landings that frequently go unreported (EPRI 1999) . A further complication is that fisheries for American eel target many life stages, from glass eels and elvers to the sexually mature silver-phase stage, yet the size and age composition of reported landings is, for the most part, undocumented. As a result, the contribution to annual harvests of individual year classes of a species that can be exploited from age 1+ to age 20+ is not known. Also, an unknown but possibly significant production of eels occurs in estuarine and coastal waters that may not be fished. Some site-specific landings data and a number of fishery independent data sets provide somewhat better insight into abundance trends in regional stocks over a limited time frame (we use the term stock to refer to groups of eels that occupy specific waterbodies, such as lakes, rivers or watersheds, during their growth to maturity, and refer to the single panmictic population of the American eel as the population. Stock as used here has no genetic basis or connotation.). Valuable data pertaining to trends in abundance of American eel in Canada were documented in Peterson (1997) . EPRI (1999) expanded those assessments to include data characterizing stock abundance trends from collections made over a geographical range from Nova Scotia to Virginia, including life stages ranging from glass eels and elvers to yellow-and silver-phase eels. Sources of data varied widely and included beach seine surveys, impingement sampling, commercial fishing, research collections, and monitoring programs. Trends in Table 1 .

Data from Casselman et al. 1997b Annual average eel catch per unit effort (number per 70 m electrofishing transect) in North Anna River, Virginia, 1981 -1997 abundance for each data set were tested over a time period (1984 to 1995) corresponding to the period of a very large decline in numbers of eels passing the R. H. Saunders ladder (Casselman et al. 1997b) . As discussed in EPRI (1999), the cyclic and sometimes erratic nature of eel recruitment may affect conclusions regarding decreases in abundance depending on the time period examined; therefore, the scope of inference of this analysis is limited to the time period selected. Significant negative trends in abundance of American eel were found in data sets from Ontario, Quebec, New York, and Virginia (Table 1) . Evidence for a decline in the St. Lawrence River is indicated by the negative trend in daily passage at the R. H. Saunders ladder (Table 1, Figure 2a ; Casselman et al. 1997b), although it is unclear as to how the operation of a downstream lock may affect access of juvenile eels to the base of the ladder. Corroborating evidence is provided by a decline in commercial electrofishing catches of yellow-phase eels in Lake Ontario (Casselman et al. 1997a) and electrofishing surveys in Virginia (Table 1, Figure 2b ). A decline in abundance was also significant for a silver-phase eel commercial weir trap dataset for the lower St. Lawrence River (Axelsen 1997). A significant negative trend was observed in Hudson River, New York beach seine survey collections, but not for fall shoal survey sampling. Impingement catches of eels at two power plant cooling water intake screens on the Hudson River showed significant declines at one (Danskammer), but not the other (Roseton). In Virginia, a significant negative trend was found in the North Anna River and for eels > 350 mm collected in the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences (VIMS) trawl survey. The observation of significant declining trends in New York and Virginia, more southerly regions of North America, provides evidence independent of the St. Lawrence River for a decline in American eel from 1984 to 1995. Other regional indices of eel abundance in Canada, including electrofishing surveys completed on the Miramichi and Restigouche rivers (New Brunswick), as well as from the Morrell River (Prince Edward Island), also show evidence for declining trends in eel abundance (Chaput 1997) . No evidence of a declining trend was found for glass eels in New Jersey, elvers in Nova Scotia, or for yellow-phase eels in commercial pot fisheries in New Hampshire or Virginia (Table 1 ). These data sets had the fewest number of points available for analysis and none had data available for dates preceding 1988 when sharp declines in abundance were observed in other data sets (e.g., North Anna River, Virginia). No significant trend in abundance was observed for eels < 350 mm TL in the VIMS trawl survey. Other time series data from 1988 to 1996 for several smaller St. Lawrence River tributaries (Caron and Verreault 1997) show neither positive nor negative trends in eel abundance. In the VIMS data, large inter-annual variability in catch for eels < 350 mm was problematic for the analysis of trends. Other plots for longer time series, such as for various statistical districts in the Lake Ontario commercial eel fishery between 1954 and 1980, exemplify large annual variability present in eel time series data (Stewart et al. 1997) . Such variability may reflect year class size variation. Localized factors not accounted for in these analyses (e.g., variable recruitment, overfishing, and passage blockages) could also interact with larger-scale processes such as a decrease in oceanic recruitment to influence trends in abundance. At the Richelieu River, a tributary of the St. Lawrence River, a significant declining trend in the catch of silverphase eels most likely reflects the long-term effect of restricting upstream passage to Lake Champlain (Axelsen 1997) . Similarly, the significantly declining trend in passage of yellow-phase eels at the R. H. Saunders eel passage facility may reflect the long-term reduction in Seaway lockages (the only direct upstream passage route) at the downstream Hydro Quebec Beauharnois Project (EPRI 1999) . A high correlation between water flow through the locks at Beauharnois and the eel index at the R. H. Saunders facility upstream has been noted (Desrochers and Fleury 1999), suggesting an anthropogenic cause for the decline noted at R. H. Saunders and possibly index sites upstream of Beauharnois (e.g., Lake Ontario). Taking into account all these caveats, however, all trends in these data sets that were statistically significant showed declining abundance over the limited time series and no positive trends in abundance were observed. There were no statistically significant trends in abundance for glass eels or elvers, but the time series for these life stages may have been too short to provide meaningful results. Other data sets showing no statistically significant changes in abundance over time (e.g., VIMS data for eels < 350 mm) generally had very high inter-annual variability. In contrast, data sets showing statistically significant declines had comparatively little annual variability, which substantially enhanced the statistical power of the tests performed to assess the various datasets (EPRI1999). Further analysis of how local factors may relate to, and influence, perceptions of large scale, populationlevel effects of depressed recruitment would be of value. Meta-analysis of these and future trend data would also provide insight as to the severity and geographic distribution of the decline. It should be noted that the datasets were derived from samples obtained with a wide variety of gear types with variable effectiveness and sampling schedules, which may contribute to interannual variability in abundance indices. A further complicating factor is that in most cases life stage and catch composition information was not available, and abundance indices could include many year classes and several life stages, such as mixes of yellowand silver-phase life stages. Also, the absence of positive trends in the data does not in itself imply the population is in decline. Positive trends, as opposed to short-term increases, are unlikely in any established fishery, and absence of trend may in fact indicate stability. However, we view negative trends in 7 of the 16 datasets as cause for concern regarding the future stability of the population as a whole, which warrants conservation measures. While intense fisheries can result in declines of exploited stocks, estimates of exploitation rates and means of combining exploitation rates for numerous regional stocks into a composite exploitation rate for the single panmictic population do not exist for the American eel. Estimates for efficiency of commercial weirs that intercept downstream migrant silver-phase eels range from 60% (European eels; Moriarty and Dekker 1997) to 98% (American eels; Kircheis 1999), but weir efficiency can be very site-specific. In some cases, nearly all of the eel production within a (Above) Eel weir on Seboeis Stream, Maine. Such weirs are used to intercept downstream migrant silver-phase eels as they emigrate to the sea. (Left) Size of adult eels can vary widely, and the sexes are dimorphic with respect to length, mass, and age; females are generally larger and older than males. The adult silver-phase eels in this photo were captured in a Maine eel weir as they emigrated to the sea: the upper two fish are females (90 and 46 cm TL), and the lower eel is a male (34 cm TL). watershed may be intercepted by a single weir, but such fisheries impact only a segment of the potential spawning stock produced within North and South America. High fishing mortality on glass eels and pigmented elvers may contribute to reduced recruitment into freshwater nursery areas, while fisheries targeting yellow-and silver-phase eels may impact regional stocks and reduce the contribution of some watersheds to the panmictic spawning population. The demand for glass eels and elvers in Asia noted earlier fostered an intensive fishery in the 1990s and generated premium prices of up to US$800 per kilogram for elvers (Meister and Flagg 1997) . These lucrative prices, coupled with minimal permit and gear costs, resulted in a \"gold rush\" for entry into the fishery. As a result, glass eel and elver fisheries inceased dramatically within a period of several years. Although fishing pressure may be quite intense locally, the absence of basic population dynamics data for American eels has precluded an evaluation of the effects of potentially high exploitation rates on regional stocks and the population. The oceanic phase of the species' life history, including migration of adults to the spawning area, spawning behavior, larval drift, and recruitment of postlarvae and glass eels to coastal areas are poorly understood.

In many diprotodontians, by contrast, damaged or sectioned skulls reveal the presence of a squamosal contribution to the floor of the hypotympanic sinus, in addition to an alisphenoid tympanic process (Aplin, 1990; Beck et al., 2008a: char. 244; Sánchez-Villagra and Forasiepi, 2017: 26, fig. 23 ). However, this squamosal tympanic process is often largely covered by the alisphenoid tympanic process, so its presence is not readily apparent based on external examination of intact skulls (Murray et al., 1987; Sánchez-Villagra, 1998: 184-185; Sánchez-Villagra and Forasiepi, 2017: 26, fig. 23 ). Indeed, in some diprotodontians, the ossified hypotympanic sinus floor is largely or entirely bilaminar, comprising an internal squamosal tympanic process and an external alisphenoid tympanic process-as in †Wakaleo (Murray et al., 1987) , †Namilamadeta, †Muramura, and †Ngapakaldia (based on SAM P13851, the holotype of †N. tedfordi; contra Murray et al., 2000: 98) .

Species Scored: †Herpetotherium fugax (type species), †H. cf. fugax. Geological Provenance of Scored Specimens: White River Formation, Wyoming. Age of Scored Specimens: All examined specimens come from the Orellan North American Land Mammal Age, which is currently estimated as spanning from 33.9 to 32.0 Mya (Prothero and Emry, 2004; Zanazzi et al., 2009) . Assigned Age Range: 33.900-32.000 Mya. Remarks: †Herpetotherium fugax is known from numerous specimens from the White River Formation, including well-preserved skulls and associated postcranial material (Gabbert, 1998; Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2007; Horovitz et al., 2008) . Sánchez-Villagra et al. (2007) included †Herpetotherium in a comprehensive morphological phylogenetic analysis of marsupials and relatives, and found that this taxon fell outside (crown-clade) Marsupialia. Most subsequent morphological and total-evidence analyses have found a similar result, in which †Herpetotherium either falls outside Marsupialia or is not unambiguously a member of this clade (Beck et al., 2008 (Beck et al., , 2014 (Beck et al., , 2016 Horovitz et al., 2008 Horovitz et al., , 2009 Beck, 2012 Beck, , 2017b Forasiepi et al., 2014a; Suarez et al., 2015; Lorente et al., 2016; Oliveira, 2017a, 2017b; Maga and Beck, 2017; Carneiro, 2018 Carneiro, , 2019 Carneiro et al., 2018; Engelman et al., 2020; Muizon et al., 2018; Abello and Candela, 2019; Rangel et al., 2019; Ladevèze et al., 2020; Muizon and Ladevèze, 2020; Zimicz and Goin, 2020) . However, a few recent pub-lished phylogenetic analyses-namely, the morphological analyses of Forasiepi (2009: fig. 51 ), Engelman and Croft (2014: fig. 6 ), and Wilson et al. (2016: fig. 3) , and the tip-and-node dated total evidence analysis of Maga and Beck (2017: fig. 39 )-have found †Herpetotherium within Marsupialia, so some questions remain regarding its affinities. †Mimoperadectes Species Scored: †Mimoperadectes labrus (type species), †M. houdei. Geological Provenance of Scored Specimens: UM Locality SC-69, lower part of Willwood Formation, Park County, Wyoming ( †Mimoperadectes labrus); UM Locality SC-133, lower part of Willwood Formation, Park County, Clark Fork Basin, Wyoming ( †M. houdei). Age of Scored Specimens: UM Locality SC-69 is within Zone Wa-0 of the Wasatchian North American Land Mammal Age (Gingerich, 2001 : fig. 11 ), whereas UM Locality SC-133 is within Zone Wa-2 (Bowen and Bloch, 2002: fig. 2, table 2) ; the maximum bound of Wa-0 is approximately 55.8 Mya, and the minimum bound of Wa-2 is approximately 55.1 Mya (Chew and Oheim, 2013: fig. 2 ). Assigned age range: 55.800-55.100 Mya. Remarks: Bown and Rose (1979) described †Mimoperadectes labrus based on incomplete, predominantly dental, specimens from the earliest Eocene of the Willwood Formation, and referred it to the family Didelphidae. Horovitz et al. (2009) described a broken but nearly complete cranium of †Mimoperadectes (USNM 482355) from a slightly younger site in the Willwood Formation, referred it to a new species, †M. houdei, and referred †Mimoperadectes to the family †Peradectidae. In the same year, Beard and Dawson (2009) (Rose et al., 2012: 22) . Of this material, only the specimens described by Bown and Rose (1979) and Horovitz et al. (2009) have been used for scoring purposes here. Horovitz et al. (2009) presented a morphological phylogenetic analysis that included a terminal combining craniodental character scores for †Mimoperadectes labrus and †M. houdei with dental character scores from †Peradectes spp. and three postcranial character scores from \"a Peradectes-like species from the Middle Eocene of Messel, Germany, which may belong to this same genus or alternatively may be closely related to it\" (Horovitz et al., 2009 : supporting information). In their analysis, the \"Mimoperadectes-Peradectes\" terminal was recovered as sister to a clade comprising the living didelphids Monodelphis and Didelphis, suggesting that it was a crown-clade marsupial and a member of the order Didelphimorphia. The morphological analysis of Wilson et al. (2016) also included a \"Mimoperadectes-Peradectes\" terminal, which again fell inside Marsupialia, as sister to †Herpetotherium, with this clade sister to Didelphidae + Dasyuridae, and Dromiciops outside this. However, the relationships among extant marsupials found by Wilson et al. (2016) are in clear conflict with molecular, total-evidence, and most morphological analyses (e.g., Phillips et al., 2001; Amrine-Madsen et al., 2003b; Horovitz and Sánchez-Villagra, 2003; Asher et al., 2004; Nilsson et al., 2004 Nilsson et al., , 2010 Phillips et al., 2006; Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2007; Beck, 2008 Beck, , 2012 Beck et al., 2008 Beck et al., , 2014 Beck et al., , 2016 Horovitz et al., 2008 Horovitz et al., , 2009 Meredith et al., 2008 Meredith et al., , 2009c Meredith et al., , 2011 Mitchell et al., 2014; Gallus et al., 2015a; May-Collado et al., 2015; Lorente et al., 2016; Carneiro and Oliveira, 2017b; Maga and Beck, 2017; Carneiro et al., 2018; Duchêne et al., 2018; Abello and Candela, 2019; Carneiro, 2019; Zimicz and Goin, 2020; Álvarez-Carretero et al., 2021) in failing to support monophyly of Australidelphia. An implicit assumption of the analyses of Horovitz et al. (2009) and Wilson et al. (2016) is that the taxa they used to score their \"Mimoperadectes-Peradectes\" terminal (i.e., †Mimoperadectes labrus, †M. houdei, †Peradectes spp., and the \"Peradectes-like species\" from Messel) form a clade to the exclusion of their other terminals. However, evidence in support of this assumption is not particularly strong. The phylogenetic analyses of Williamson et al. (2012; recovered †Mimoperadectes labrus and †M. houdei as sister taxa in a clade that also included †Peradectes chesteri and †P. protinnominatus (as well as †Armintodelphys blacki and †A. dawsoni), which supports a close relationship between †Mimoperadectes and these particular †Peradectes species. However, other †Peradectes species included by Williamson et al. (2012 Williamson et al. ( , 2014 )namely †P. minor (the type species), †P. californicus, †P. coproxeches (= †Peradectes, sp. nov., in Williamson et al., 2012 ; see Williamson and Taylor, 2011) , †P. elegans, and †P. gulottai-were not resolved as members of this clade, but instead formed part of a polytomy (within which †P. elegans and †P. californicus were sister taxa) that also included the †Mimoperadectes + †Armintodelphys + †P. chesteri + †P. protinnominatus clade discussed above, †Maastrichtidelphys, †Pucadelphys, †Szalinia, and †Pediomyidae. Thus, the analyses of Williamson et al. (2012; do not unambiguously support monophyly of †Peradectes nor monophyly of †Mimoperadectes + †Peradectes. Williamson et al. (2012; referred to the taxa forming this polytomy, but excluding †Pediomyidae, as \"Peradectidae sensu lato, \" and Williamson et al. (2012: 629) specifically argued that future studies would place at least some of these taxa within a monophyletic †Peradectidae sensu stricto, which they defined as \"the most inclusive clade containing Peradectes elegans, but not Herpetotherium fugax, Pediomys elegans or Didelphis virginiana\" (Williamson et al., 2012: 629) . Carneiro and Oliveira (2017b) and Carneiro (2018) recovered a clade comprising †Mimoperadectes, †Peradectes, and †Thylacodon (the last genus having been regarded as synonymous with †Peradectes by some authors; see Williamson et al., 2012) , although they did not specify exactly which species they used to score these terminals. In two other papers, Carneiro et al. (2018) and Carneiro (2019) found a clade that they called †Peradectidae comprising †Mimoperadectes; †Peradectes; †Thylacodon; the North American taxa †Golderdelphys, †Nanodelphys, and †Didelphidectes; †Siamoperadectes from Thailand; and an unnamed taxon from the Itaboraí Local Fauna of Brazil. Rangel et al. (2019) , meanwhile, also found a †Mimoperadectes + †Peradectes clade (they did not include †Thylacodon or the other putative peradectids used by Carneiro et al. [2018] and Carneiro [2019] ), but again it is unclear exactly which species were used for scoring purposes.

Further, members of several distinct genetic clusters share crown paĴ erns that correspond with formerly recognized genera.
