', 'Notemigonus crysoleucas and Aplodinotus grunniens are widespread and range from the Gulf of Mexico, and Guatemala, respectively, north some distance into Canada. ', 'Lepisosteus sp. ', 'and Ictalurus punctatus are not found north of Lake Huron, southern Manitoba, or southern Ontario, although they are common south to the Gulf of Mexico and in northern M6xico. ', 'Semotilus atromaculatus and Catostomus cornmersoni are most abundant in the northern part of North America, but they are found some distance south of the Oklahoma panhandle. ', 'Their absence from the immediate vicinity of the Berends fauna is explained by the lack of suitable spawning areas, although such gravel beds were available to them during glacial times. ', 'Percaflavescens is the species that most closely restricts the southern limit of the fauna, for it is not found south of northern Fig. 7.

', 'SUMMARY The Berends Pleistocene fauna of Beaver County, Oklahoma, contains abundant remains of vertebrates and mollusks. ', 'Twelve fishes have been identified and by superimposing the ranges of all of them we find that the comparable present-day fauna inhabits the region from Minnesota to western New York and from the north shore of Lake Huron to central Iowa, central Indiana, and northern Ohio. ', 'The conclusion that the climate of the Great Plains was cooler and more moist when this fauna existed is borne out by other groups. ', 'The molluscan and mammalian fossils consist also of forms whose descendents or close relatives live in a cooler and moister climate than exists in that region today. ', 'Pine, fir, and spruce pollen have been found in the deposits from which the fish remains came and this supports the zoological evidence of climatic change.

', 'It is therefore possible that different dietary or habitat shifts among these species of Enteromius may explain why two species have proportionately larger barbels as juveniles, while two others have proportionately longer barbels as adults. ', 'Perhaps the adults of E. camptacanthus and E. chiumbeensis spend more time foraging benthically than do adults of the other two species? ', 'Intriguingly, the co-occurring Enteromius pinnimaculatus and Enteromius chiumbeensis differ substantially in allometric coefficients.

', 'No detailed data on microhabitat preferences or the developmental biology of these species exist, so this and any other hypothesis for the difference in barbel allometry is speculative at best.

Although the description mentions no paratypes, the following specimens, as well as ZMB 29819 are currently regarded as part of the type series: MCZ 126238-375, 169013, 18126-29,18143-50; FMNH 73379; UIMNH 41515; UMMZ 59029 (4specimens); USNM 75946-9; ZMA 11216-9.

STUMPFF. The ZMB specimen was obtained from BOETTGEK in 1882 (archival material) shortly after more specimens had been obtained by the Senckenberg (BOETTGER 1881). The spelling of the specific epithet was altered to the presently used form by BOETTGER (1879b: 474). MERTENS (1967) lists S M F 8304 (originally S M F 4086, i a ) as the lectotype. This specimen should, however, be regarded as a holotype.
